(or rather, GB Hunter is the American version of the Game Booster.)

## Compatibility and features

    - Basic color palettes
- Custom color palettes
- Four Datel-designed borders that can be selected by the user

## Hidden game: "Rebound Mission"

The Game Booster contains a built-in Game Boy game, "Rebound Mission", that can be played by starting it up without a Game Boy cartridge plugged in. This game is not present in the GB Hunter.
