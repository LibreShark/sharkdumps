## Game Booster

Game Booster is the European version of GB Hunter
(or rather, GB Hunter is the American version of the Game Booster.)

Like the GB Hunter, Game Booster supports:

- Super Game Boy-enhanced games
    - Special border graphics
    - Basic color palettes
- Custom color palettes
- Four Datel-designed borders that can be selected by the user
- Preloaded list of GameShark / Action Replay cheats
- Manual cheat code entry
- Trainer for finding new cheat codes

Game Booster ***does not support*** Game Boy Color games.

### Hidden game: "Rebound Mission"

The Game Booster contains a built-in Game Boy game, "Rebound Mission", that can be played by starting it up without a Game Boy cartridge plugged in. This game is not present in the GB Hunter.
