<tr><th>Version 1.08</th><th>7/26/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Hopefully, fixed the No$GBA hooking in a more accurate way. The previous build was working good an any rom over 10 megs, but broke on small ones.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.07</th><th>7/20/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
I fixed an issue with In Range searches and got standard makefiles seemingly working. I haven't bothered to strip the Dev-C++ files yet. This version is an in between step before I start totally fucking with things, if I can be bothered to.
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.06</th><th>6/09/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Well, the search issue with No$GBA could potentially be solved here. The method I was using to find the NDS RAM within No$GBA was looking for the header, which also appears at the start of the ROM. It looks like it was finding the ROM for some people instead of the RAM. I *think* I found a way around that.
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Hopefully fixed No$GBA searching/support.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.05</th><th>4/20/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
Still haven't figured out that issue some people are having with the 2nd search yielding 0 results. It's possible there's a memory protection issue. I need to look into the DumpRAM function and try some extra error checks when I have time. I'm also curious if anyone who's had this issue tried finding their own starting point for the particular emulator using tsearch or the like.
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed some interface issues in the Mupen version. Seems dropping the Hook tab the way I did was causing some problems. It's now disabled without changing tab order.</li>
 <li>Added the 'I Forgot' search option. I always wondered what that was for in GSCC2k. Thanks LazyBastard.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.04</th><th>3/27/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
The search results issue is still there. Only seems to appear with no$gba. I'm at a loss on that one. Current rex.cfg (v1.03) should be ok with this one. The default PCSX2 0.9.6 address was fixed, but it's probably dodgy and likely OS specific (4DB1000, static). I still encourage deleting the CFG every version though. This is why I made code DBs save separately.
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug with the code handler in the Mupen version. I think I got it right this time.</li>
 <li>Fixed preset list scrolling (or lack there of).</li>
 <li>Fixed a minor issue with saving/loading Cheat DBs. I've been wondering why it would ask me to save the DB when I open Renegade sometimes. I found the bitch now.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.03</th><th>3/11/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
I think I solved the issue with the code hanlder in the Mupen integrated version. There's still an odd bug with the search results sometimes that I haven't gotten a handle on.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: Delete your old rex.cfg before using this version.
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug with the code handler in the Mupen version.</li>
 <li>Added PCSX 0.9.6 to the presets. Keep in mind the address may only be good on the specific version of windows I'm running (XP 64-bit SP2). I was unable to find a pointer.</li>
 <li>Fixed that little issue with the edit box in the memory editor. It was running out of space before all 8 characters could be entered if using caps.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Version 1.02</th><th>2/6/09</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
I think the code handler is sort of fucked. I tried about 4 codes with the Mupen integrated version and only saw effect from 1. Feels like it's not writing fast enough, even though it should be.
<br/><br/>
NOTE: Delete your old rex.cfg before using this version.
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Added an option to the search results to make the memory editor jump to each result clicked.</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug in the memory editor. Goto was getting fucked up when byteswapping was on. I guess it helps to check which column is being edited before swapping bytes.</li>
 <li>Improved the NDS support a bit. It will now attempt to find the RAM portion of No$GBA if the pointer is no good. This is actually a lot quicker than I expected. The downside is it leaves the potential for offset issues between hardware and emulator addresses. Ever try to hack Mario 64 DS with HasteDS? It's 0x4000 off because HasteDS starts at the game's entrypoint in ram, which isn't always 02000000. The Entry Offset box will subtract an offset from the start address if needed. The easiest way to tell if a game is off is look up an address you already know in the memory editor.</li>
</ul>

<tr><td colspan="2">
I meant to work on this sooner, but I guess it wouldn't have made much difference. The assholes that work on PCSX2 haven't updated the damn Dev-C++ project file since 2007, so it won't compile that way anymore. So much for adding Renegade to it. :(
<br/><br/>
Changes:<br/>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed that nasty little bug in the search results. If you used Page Down to the end of the list then clicked one, it would crash.</li>
 <li>Added 16-bit Upper/Lower exclusions to the advanced search options.</li>

<tr><td>This is a complete rewrite of Renegade all done with C/Win32 API. Most of the important stuff from the old Renegade has made a return. You may notice a few additions/changes, as well as a somewhat better GUI.<br /><br />
Current Features:
<ul>
<li>Code Search</li>
<li>Emulator Trainer</li>
<li>Memory Editor</li>
<li>Probably the only Readme you'll ever see that's valid XHTML 1.1. ;-)</li>

<table><tr><th id="mupen">Mupen - RenegadeEx Edition</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Same stuff as RenegadeEx, but it's built into the Mupen 0.5 source (Utilities menu). At the very least, this should allow codes that modify the ASM to actually work. Other emulators, whether with Renegade or builtin cheat ability, lack the ability to automatically reset the dynamic recompiler shit that they use. If you're running anything with a pure intepretor core, this shouldn't be an issue anyway. In any case, codes should work better than other emulators in most cases.
</td></tr>
</table><br /><br />
<table><tr><th id="hook">Hooking to an Emulator/PC Game</th></tr>
<tr><td>
This new Renegade features a more detailed editor for attaching to processes. It's not meant for total n00bs, but people with a reasonable understanding of hacking and offsets shouldn't be overly confused by it.
</td></tr>
 <tr><th>Attaching to a PC Game</th></tr>
 <tr><td>This isn't complicated at all. Choose the process from the list of the left or launch+hook. Whatever your pleasure. When hooking a game, be sure to tick the box for 'Full Process.'</td></tr>
 <tr><th>Attaching to an Emulator</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Now this is where it gets interesting. Most of the options are pretty self-explanatory. The hard part is finding start offsets/pointers. What you need to find out about your emulator before you can hack console codes is where exactly the console RAM is located within the emulator's RAM. Start by loading a game in the emulator that we already have codes for and setting up a plain old PC game hook; you can also use other PC hacking tools if desired. Now hack a code you already know the console address for. I'll use Goldeneye running on PJ64 1.6 as an example. I hacked ammo for my right gun on the Dam level. Came up with 3B1737FC. The console address is D37FC. Can you subtract? Good. The N64 RAM begins at 3B0A0000. Are we done? Well, some emulators always load console RAM to the same place, some don't. Open the emulator again with a different game loaded and do the same thing again. If you come up with the same starting address (3B0A0000 in our case), you're set; that's your "RAM Start." Otherwise, we need to go a step farther and look for a pointer to the start address. This is really simple, believe it or not. Find your start address again. Once again, we'll say we figured it out to be 3B0A0000 for the start of console RAM. Now, do a 32-bit search for that value. Yes, SEARCH FOR '3B0A0000' NOOBS. You'll probably see 20 or so results. A lot of times, the first one is all you need. Record them all to a text file though. First one on my list is 4D6A1C. To check this, load up the emulators again and find a start address AGAIN. If this address is once again found at that location (4D6A1C) then the pointer should be good. Now hack something.</td></tr>
</table><br /><br />


<table><tr><th id="codesearch">Code Searcher Info</th></tr>
<tr><td>This has most of the same options as the original Renegade. You'll notice options to change the type of input for value searches. You'll also notice a progress bar. You should be aware that hacknig PC games is slowest because there's a lot to dump and compare. After the first search or two, it should speed up though. Searches will also tend to be slightly slower when applying certain extra filtering options from the extended options list. P.S. Before you ask "Where can I set the area? I only want 80100000-80200000" or some shit, check out the extended option "Include only results wthin a specified address range." Can you guess what that's for?
</td></tr>
 <tr><th>Results Tab</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Clicking any result will copy the address and the value from the column you click on to the input boxes for activating. Doubleclicking will add it straight to the active list with that value.</td></tr>
</table><br /><br />

<table><tr><th id="memedit">Memory Editor Info</th></tr>
<tr><td>The memory editor bares some resemblance to Nemu's this time around. Doubleclicking will allow you to edit any column but the text. Editing the Address column is equivilent to Go To; it'll jump to the address entered.
