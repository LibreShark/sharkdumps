Viper's Insane File Tool
~written by Viper187 through the teachings of Parasyte, Dlong, Kenobi, and others

current version: 1.1

Can compare files (i.e. RAM dumps) from anything or disassemble R4300i. If you can't find the right comparison option in this program, you're more fucked up than Viper. This one's written in C, so it's faster than Cheater64. :)

New features:
R4300i Disassembler

Notes: 

*I wouldn't advise closing the app without using the exit option, unless 
it's necessary.

*This doesn't support zipped or gzipped files. uncompress shit before searching!

*Note on the R4300i Disassembler: I noticed that Niew ignores the fact that 
certain bits are supposed to be empty and shows opcodes form values it shouldn't. I 
made this check for those empty bits for more accurate output (hopefully). :)
