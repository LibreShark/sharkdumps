Cheater64 Readme

WARNING: 

There is a known problem in Windows XP with folder attributes. If 
you've searched a time or two, you'll notice that Cheater 64 has 
created a "searches" folder wherever the EXE is. If you experience 
an "Access Denied" type error when trying to start a new search, 
this is most likely because M$ sucks!! You'll have to open the 
command prompt, and issue the following two commands. This should 
fix it.

attrib +S C:\YourCheater64Folder\searches /S /D
attrib -R C:\YourCheater64Folder\searches /S /D


v2.1 - 3/18/03

*More shit fixed, and probably more shit broken in the process.

*GUI should actually fit on an 800x600 resolution screen now.

*Flag Search - Search for values that are different by a specified 
number of bits.

*Greater/Less/Different By searches. Started as a little idea and 
ended up a project in itself, since I thought of 3 ways to do each. 
Not all of these support 32bit searching.


v2.1 - 3/15/03

*Improved the search routine's speed a little more by only grabbing 
values that need compared instead of all of them. It used to read in 
the entire RAM dump and do comparisons as needed. Now it checks the 
results to see if it needs to read each address.

*Added Undo and Load features. You'll be able to undo search if you 
choose to save an undo buffer. When you start the program, it will 
also check for old searches and result files. If they exist, you're 
given the option to load them.

*fixed a couple funny little bugs.


v2.0 - 3/14/03

This version is entirely rewritten in order to speed things up. The 
searches are pretty well tolerable now, as far as speed. As usual, 8bit 
comparisons will probably be slowest. Big thanx to Para for teaching me 
all this shit, writing some functions, etc.

New Features:

*Searches can now be done with Decimal, Hex, and Floats! Para wrote this 
neat DLL to convert to and from FPS. Now everyone go find Pi and mess 
with it like Phantom did on Goldeneye & PD. :-D

*Ignore Pointers - This option basicly ignores everything that appears to 
be part of a pointer (value 80000000 - 807FFFFF). Yes, even on 8bit and 
16bit searches.

*Comparing To - This allows you to compare to old values form the current 
search. If you choose not to save searches, you have access to the 
previous value, which can still be helpful.

*Not In Range Searches

*'Greater Or Equal' To and 'Less Than Or Equal To' searches

*Choose the number of results to display - The more you display, the longer 
it'll take to come up, but I thought I leave some option as to how many are 
shown.

*When exporting search results in GS code format, 32bit values will be 
seperated into 2 16bit codes for easy use. :) 

*Probably some new bugs ;-)


v1.2 - 8/25/03

Hopefully got the Initial Search unfucked. I also added an option 
that I think will prove useful. The "On/Off/Have/Don't Have/etc" 
aka Flip Flop search, is intended for finding those annoying little 
things that you know are always the same 2 values (like on/off 
switches). The way it works is you do your typical Initial dump, 
then Different To. Now you have your 2 values. 1-the initial (off) 
value, 2-the 2nd (On) value. And you just keep switching on/of and 
searching, as opposed to using Greater/Less shit and hopefully drop 
the possibilities quicker. NOTE: Only advanced users should attempt
mixing this search with other search options.
