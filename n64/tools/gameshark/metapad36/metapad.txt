What?
=====
If you are like me, one of the most useful programs for everyday use is
Microsoft Notepad. I realized that Notepad was quite powerful and did 
almost everything I wanted in a simple text editor. Yet I found the UI 
to be unlike most 32-bit Windows applications and actually quite poor...

Metapad is a small, fast (and completely free) text editor for Windows 
9x and Windows NT (2000) with similar features to Microsoft Notepad but 
with many extra (and rather useful) features. It was designed to 
completely replace Notepad since it includes (just about) all of 
Notepad's features and much, much more.

Why?
====
I created this program as a personal project. I was simply annoyed with
the poor usability of Notepad and it was clear that Microsoft wasn't 
ever going to improve it (although their latest versions now have some 
minor improvements). I was pleased with the outcome of Metapad (I 
actually renamed notepad.exe to notepadx.exe and use Metapad instead of
Notepad) so I decided to release it as freeware.

How?
====
Metapad was created (as was Notepad) in pure ANSI C with the Win32 API.
It contained around 1200 lines of code as of version 1 and now has about
7000 lines as of version 3.0. Thus, it is almost as small and just about
as fast as Notepad is. Unlike some other so-called Notepad replacements,
Metapad actually loads in an instant. (Those other programs tend to 
approach 1 or 2MB instead of being under 100KB and are written using C++
with MFC or even, gasp!, Visual Basic.) 

Installation
============
Metapad was designed to completely replace Notepad. To see how you can
install Metapad to replace Notepad see the metaFAQ page on the Metapad 
web site (see contact information at the end of this document).
