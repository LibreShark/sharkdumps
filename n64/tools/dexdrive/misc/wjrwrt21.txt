0. What's new ?
===============
In V2.1:
- Fixed a bug in V2 which could cause unpredictable results

In V2:
- Support for PV-BackUp (a homemade V64Jr. from Valery Pudov - http://www.pro.com.ru/)
- Support for Win 2K 
- Bootemulator support
- Checksum calc. for all known CIC's (just like RN64CRC)
- Changed/Updated the GUI
- Fixed a few bugs (support for files < 1Mbit) etc. etc. :)


1. What is this program for ?
=============================
This program was made because I was not satisfied with the send-utility for windows that comes 
with Doctor V64 Jr. So I decided to make a more "Windows integrated" send-utility 
(and info utility) for the Doctor V64 Jr and now also support for PV-Backup Unit.


2. Requirements
===============
- A PC with EPP LPT Port and MS Windows9x / NT 4.0 / 2000 - See NT section for more info!
- A Doctor V64 Jr. or a PV-BackUp Unit (attached to the PC via. the parallel port) :)


3. How To Install..
===================
  Create a new folder on your HD and unzip (with WinZip) this package. 
  Start the program wJrWrite.exe via explore or Start -> Run. 
  You could make a shortcut to the wJrWrite.exe program. 

  3.1 Windows 9x / ME
  ===================
  You can delete DLPORTIO.sys If you don't plan to use Win NT / 2000

  3.2 Windows NT 4.0 / Windows 2000
  =================================
  In version 2 of wJrWrite I have included DLPORTIO.sys which should be placed in your
  in your \WinNT\System32\Drivers folder. Move DLPORTIO.dll to the \WinNT\System32 folder
  wJrWrite will load the driver by itself when needed. 

  (if you get any DriverLinx errors then search and remove DLPORTIO.sys and .dll from all other
   location than mentioned above)

   
4. How to Use the program (setup)
=================================
When you start the program you see 3 tabs: 

  4.1 Unit Info 
  =============
  On this page, you can see if the program has found the backup unit. If not you can click on 
  Find It! and wJrWrite will start searching on your LPT-port(s).  

  If you don't see any values or valid values in the "Available LPT ports" line, then select 
  LPT-Ports -> Fixed from the system-menu (left click the wJrWrite icon on the titlebar).

  This will write the "most used" values to the registry. IF the port-values shown does not 
  match your configuration then you can edit them manually by using regedit under the following 
  key : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\wJr_Tools\LPT Ports

  If you wish to activate the build-in port detection again then select LPT-Ports -> AutoDetect
  (The Port values in the registry will be deleted)

  If you are having trouble detecting the Unit then try selecting your unit from Unit in 
  system-menu (AutoDetect is default).

  4.2 ROM File Types
  ==================
  
  4.2.1 Extensions
  ================ 
  In the Extension checklistbox you can set / unset the extensions you add. I have pre-defined
  .rom, .v64 and .z64  You add extensions by entering them in the editbox below the
  checklistbox and press enter or click on the button "Add Extension".

  4.2.2  PopUp menu for extensions
  ================================
  - Add / Edit Offset      (Will be disabled if no extesion is selected as active).
  A small window will popup, where you can enter the offset (in hex) for the extension. 
  Remeber the offset must be an even number. Valid offsets are numbers between $2 - $ffffe.
    
  If you wish to delete an existing offset, then enter 0 (zero) in the edit-box.

  - Select All
  This will select (register) all extensions listed in the checklistbox.

  - Select None
  This will de-select (un-register) all extensions listed in the checklistbox.

  - Remove <extension>   (Will be disabled if no extesion is selected).
  This will remove the selected extension from the checklistbox. If the selected extension 
  was checked the association will be removed.
    
  4.2.3  Default Action
  =====================        
  Selects what acion wJrWrite should do, when you dbl. click on an associated file in 
  e.g. explorer.

  4.2.4  N64 Rom File Icon
  ========================
  Select an icon to use with the associated files.

  - Load Icon
  You can load an icon by dbl. clicking the icon shown in N64 Rom File Icon.

  - Removed (disabled if current icon is an internal!)..
  This will remove the loaded icon.

  Select the desired icon by using the two arrows under the icon. 

  4.3 BootEmulator
  ================
  Here you can specify which bootemulator you wish to use for a certain CIC. 

  4.3.1 Action
  ============
  dbl. click "Action" to change the action. Actions can be:
  Nothing = wJrWrite does nothing - just send the ROM file..
  Use     = wJrWrite will use a file 
  Ask	  = wJrWrite will ask you if you wish to us the bootemulator file or select another
            one.

  4.3.2 BootEmulator
  ==================
  dbl. click in the box to select a bootemulator file (= a valid N64 ROM file).

  4.3.3 Selection apply all CIC's
  ===============================
  When checked then the changes you make to one will be used on all the others



  4.4 Options / About
  ===================
  On This page you can set the following:

   - Warn if filesize is bigger than the Unit's RAM.
   This will show a warning if you try to send a file which is bigger than your Unit's RAM.

   - Calc CRC's:
    - When Needed:  wJrWrite will calculate the CRC's of the ROM file if it is smaller than                          2Mbit or if the CRC's differs from the original CRC's. The new CRC's will be written 
      to the Units RAM..

    - Always: wJrWrite will calculate the CRC's when ever a valid N64 ROM file is send to the
      unit.

    - Never: wJrWrite will never do any calculations.

   - Allow transfer of files without a valid header
   When checked wJrWrite will send all files with or without a valid N64 ROM header.

   - Quit wJrWrite after succesfull sending (Show Info).
   When selected: wJrWrite will quit after sending a file from within Show Info. 
 

5. How to use the program (general).
====================================
When you are using explorer or desktop then simply dbl. click on one of your N64-files with an 
extension that you have specified in the setup. wJrWrite will either 6. Show N64 ROM Info or
7. Send N64 ROM file.


6. Show N64 ROM Info
====================
Here you see some details/info about the file(s). 

  6.1 Send File (Ctrl + s) Or Enter Key
  =====================================
  Sends the file to the backup Unit (can be cancelled by pressing ESC key or stop button 
  during send).

  During send - wJrWrite will swap the bytes of a N64 ROM file (on the fly) if needed! So you
  don't have to convert them before sending them..

  6.2 Send File - Overriding BootEmulator (Shift + Ctrl + s) Or (Shift + Enter key)
  =================================================================================
  This will do the same as 6.1.1, but if you have choosen a BootEmulator and set wJrWrite to
  either ask or use it then it won't happen. wJrWrite will just send the ROM file skipping the
  bootemulator.


  6.3 Check CRC (Ctrl + a) or (Shift + Ctrl + a)
  ==============================================
  This will perfom a CRC's check on the ROM-file. a checkmark will appear after the CRC's 
  values if they are OK. Otherwise the line will become RED and a minus sign will be shown.

  You can choose to calculate CRC's for all files or just the selected one by using the 
  button pulldown menu.

 
  6.4 Copy Info to Clipboard (Ctrl + c) or (Shift + Ctrl + c)
  ===========================================================
  Copy the N64 Info for the selected or for all N64 ROM files to the clipboard.


  6.5 StatusBar
  =============
  Here you can get a statusbar shown at the buttom of the window with various info.


7. Send N64 ROM File
====================
This is the same as in 6.1 and it will use a bootemulator if you selected one from the
setup.


8. How to Uninstall the program.
===============================
- Simply start the program (setup) and choose Remove Settings From Registry from the 
  system-menu (left-click the wJrWrite icon on the titlebar).

- Delete the folder where the wJrWrite files are.
