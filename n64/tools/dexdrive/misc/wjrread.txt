1. What is this program for ?
=============================
This program is for dumping your N64 cartridges from a V64Jr. / PV-Backup Unit. 
It supports the following CIC-NUS 6102, 6103, 6105 and 6106. (6101 is left out because
it is only used in one game which is Lylat Wars / StarFox 64).

I have included PV-Backup unit in the docs, but the matter of fact is that we are having
some trouble getting a clean backup from the unit, so I've decided to remove the PV-Backup
support in the program for now.. When wJrRead is working 100% with that unit I'll release 
a V1.1 with support for it...


2. Requirements
===============
- A PC with LPT port (EPP 1.9) and MS Windows9x / NT 4.0 / 2000 - See NT section for more info!
- A Doctor V64 Jr. / PV-Backup Unit (attached to the PC via. the parallel port) :)
- Bootcode files. These data can be extracted from demos, games etc. with eg. RN64CRC


3. How To Install..
===================
  Create a new folder on your HD and unzip (with WinZip) this package. 
  Start the program wJrRead.exe via explore or Start -> Run. 
  You could make a shortcut to the wJrRead.exe program. 


  3.1 Windows 9x / ME
  ===================
  You can delete DLPORTIO.sys If you don't plan to use Win NT / 2000

  3.2 Windows NT 4.0 / Windows 2000
  =================================
  I have included DLPORTIO.sys which should be placed in your in your \WinNT\System32\Drivers 
  folder. Move DLPORTIO.dll to the \WinNT\System32 folder wJrRead will load the driver by 
  itself when needed. 

  You must store the bootcodefiles in the same folder where you placed wJrRead

  (if you get any DriverLinx errors then search and remove DLPORTIO.sys and .dll from all other
   location than mentioned above)

   
4. How to Use the program. 
==========================
  IMPORTANT: To successfully backup a cartridge, it must be plugged directly into the unit
  Be sure to remove any cartridges that may be sitting inbetween the game cartridge and the 
  unit such as DX256, DS1, GS etc.

  4.1 Unit / About 
  ================
  On this page, you can see if the program has found the unit. If not you can click on 
  Find It! and wJrRead will start searching on your LPT-port(s).  

  After the unit when the unit is found then you can "Detect Mbit Installed" by default 
  wJrRead will assume that you have a 256 Mbit unit.

  You can select NTSC if your NTSC N64 TV / monitor (Yes I am a PAL User) :) 

  If you have trouble detecting your unit then you can use the system menu to select what
  unit you are using and if wJrRead should autodetect your LPT port(s).

  
  4.2 BackUp Cartridge
  ====================
  (This tab will only be visible if/when your Unit was found by wJrRead).

  4.2.1 Cartridge Size MBit 
  =========================
  This is the size (in Mbit) to backup from the cartridge it can be any number between 
  32 and 512.

  4.2.2 Use BootCode
  ==================
  Here you select what bootcode (CIC-NUS chip) the cartridge have. wJrRead dosen't contain 
  any bootcodes at all since this is copyrighted material (by Nintendo), so you have to 
  use another program (e.g. RN64CRC.EXE) to extract them from other ROMS or get them elsewhere. 
  Place them in the same folder where you placed wJrRead.

  It dosen't matter if they are in .BIN or .V64 format wJrRead can use both formats.

  When clicking "Refresh bootcode list" wJrRead will search for valid bootcode files in the
  directory where wJrRead is installed.

  4.2.3 Working directory
  =======================
  Here you enter or select (by dbl. clicking the edit-box) where wJrRead can store data during 
  backup. By default your Windows Temp. folder is used.

  4.2.4 Verify (By a 2nd copy)
  ============================
  When enabled then wJrRead will make 2 copies of the cartridge and then compare them. 
  Regardless if this option is choosen or not wJrRead will make a CRC check when the backup
  is done.

  4.2.5 Save Log File
  ===================
  This will save a log of the backup progress in the folder where you store the ROM file 
  with a .Log extension
 

  When you are ready press "Start Backup" and follow the instructions on the screen and you 
  will soon have made your first copy! :)

  After a succesfull copy a save dialog will appear where you enter a name for the ROM and 
  press save. The ROM is saved in V64 format...

 
  4.3 "Start Backup" / Backup Status screen
  =========================================
  When you click "Start Backup" from the Backup Cartridge page then wJrRead will alter the 
  N64 backup ROM upon the size, CIC-NUS type you have choosen and send it to the Unit, 
  recalc the CRC's and ask you to turn on the N64 ..  You should see a screen on the N64
  with "Backup In progress.."  when it say "Backup Done.." then you can turn off the N64 again
  and press "OK" button in wJrRead it will then transfer the data back to the PC.  This is what
  I call a "turn" you can read below how many "turns" it takes to backup cartridges depending
  on their size in Mbit and your Unit.



5. BackUp cartridges > 256 Mbit on a V64Jr./PV-Backup Unit
==========================================================
You can backup cartridges which is bigger than 256 Mbit on your 256Mbit V64Jr. But you can't
test the backup. It is done in 2 "turns". Take a look at the table below to see how many "turns"
is needed with or without Verify..

 w/o Verify:    
   -V64Jr./PV-Backup     256 Mbit  512 Mbit.
   cart. <= 256 Mbit       1 turn    1 turn
   cart. > 256 Mbit	   2 turns   1 turn

 With Verify:
   -V64Jr./ PV-Backup    256 Mbit  512 Mbit.
   cart. <= 256 Mbit       2 turns   2 turns
   cart. > 256 Mbit	   4 turns   2 turns
  

6. Files In The Archive
========================
