LemAsm - N64 Rom editor/assembler by Lemmy



This readme.txt sucks, but I hope the program is easy to use so you hopefully won't need it anyway :)



Main program features
 - Allows you to edit existing n64 rom files
 - Has Hex Viewer, Mips Editor and image viewer
 - Loads rom completely into memory, so there is no need to do a backup before loading into LemAsm
 - Calculates the CRC when saving using a crc algorythm compatible with Mario's bootcode
 - Allows you to easily load the rom into an emulator to test it (only tried nemu ;))
 - Can change size of a rom
 - Directly jump to an address (press F4)
 - Byteswap feature
 - Wordswap feature

Features of MIPS assembler/disassembler (activate by pressing F3 in MIPS disassembly mode)
 - Can show registers as R0,R1,R2... or R0,AT,V0,V1...
 - Immediate values are decimal if entered as "1234", or hexadecimal if entered as "$1234"
 - Supports all known opcodes of the n64 main cpu, including COP0 and COP1 opcodes
 - Allows you to enter hex values directly by pressing $

Features of image viewer
 - Supports formats 5551 and 8888



Conclusion: If you know Niew, you should have no problem using LemAsm. Main reason I wrote it was that Niew doesn't support cop0 or cop1 (or I am too stupid).
