=============
- Fixed a bug in V1 which could cause unpredictable results!


1. What is this program for ?
=============================
This program is for dumping your N64 cartridges from a V64Jr. / PV-Backup Unit. 
It supports the following CIC-NUS 6102, 6103, 6105 and 6106. (6101 is left out because
it is only used in one game which is Lylat Wars / StarFox 64).

I have included PV-Backup unit in the docs, but the matter of fact is that we are having
some trouble getting a clean backup from the unit, so I've decided to remove the PV-Backup
support in the program for now.. When JrRead is working 100% with that unit I'll release 
a V1.1 with support for it...


2. Requirements
===============
- A PC with LPT port (EPP 1.9) and MS Windows9x / NT 4.0 / 2000 - See NT section for more info!
- A Doctor V64 Jr. / PV-Backup Unit (attached to the PC via. the parallel port) :)
- Bootcode files. These data can be extracted from demos, games etc. with eg. RN64CRC


3. How To Install..
===================
  Create a new folder on your HD and unzip (with WinZip) this package. 
  Start the program JrRead.exe via MS-DOS Prompt.

  3.1 Windows 9x / ME
  ===================
  You can delete DLPORTIO.sys If you don't plan to use Win NT / 2000

  3.2 Windows NT 4.0 / Windows 2000
  =================================
  I have included DLPORTIO.sys which should be placed in your in your \WinNT\System32\Drivers 
  folder. Move DLPORTIO.dll to the \WinNT\System32 folder JrRead will load the driver by 
  itself when needed. 

  You must store the bootcodefiles in the same folder where you placed JrRead

  (if you get any DriverLinx errors then search and remove DLPORTIO.sys and .dll from all other
   location than mentioned above)

   
4. How to Use the program. 
==========================
  IMPORTANT: To successfully backup a cartridge, it must be plugged directly into the unit
  Be sure to remove any cartridges that may be sitting inbetween the game cartridge and the 
  unit such as DX256, DS1, GS etc.


  Start a MS-DOS prompt and go to the directory where you placed JrRead. 
  You can write jrRead and press enter to get see the help screen. 

  Syntax : [-v64jr<port> / -pvb<port>] -MBXXX -CICXXXX -512 -verify -File<FileName> -NTSC


  4.1 Parameters
  ==============
  
  4.1.1 -v64jr<port> / -pvb<port>
  ===============================
  IF this parameter is left out then JrRead will use an autodetection routine to detect
  your unit and LPT port(s).

  <Port> can either be in hex or decimal (eg. $378 or 888). 

  You can combine the unit and port. eg. -v64Jr alone will trigger the autodetection for 
  the <port> only. 


  4.1.2 -MBit<Number>  / -MB<Number>
  ==================================
  Set the size in Mbit you wish to backup from the cartridge. <Number> is a valid integer
  between 32 and 512.

  4.1.3 -CIC<Bootcode ID>
  =======================
  Select what bootcode (CIC-NUS chip) the cartridge have. JrRead or the N64 Backup ROM dosen't
  contain any at all since this is copyrighted material (by Nintendo), so you have to use 
  another program (e.g. RN64CRC.EXE) to extract them from other ROMS or get them elsewhere. 
  Place them in the same folder where you placed JrRead. 

  It dosen't matter if they are in .BIN or .V64 format JrRead can use both formats.

  <BootCode ID> can be 6102, 6103, 6105 or 6106

  4.1.4 -512
  ==========
  This tells JrRead that you are using a 512 Mbit unit (default is 256). This option is only
  used when you backup cartridges bigger than 256 Mbit.
  (see "BackUp cartridges > 256 Mbit on a V64Jr./PV-Backup Unit" section).

  4.1.5 -Verify / -V
  ==================
  Tells JrRead to make 2 copies of the cartridge and then compare them. 
  Regardless if this option is choosen or not JrRead will make a CRC check when the backup
  is done.

  4.1.6 -File<FileName> / -F<FileName>
  ====================================
  The filename of the backup. If you use space then use " (eg. -File"D:\my folder\test it.v64")
  The ROM is saved in V64 format.


  4.1.7 -NTSC
  ===========
  If you are using a NTSC N64 / TV .. (PAL is default) :) 


  
  4.2 Working directory
  =====================
  jrRead uses the current directory as "working directory", a good rule is to have 3 * ROM size
  free. So if you use -verify and make a backup of 256Mbit make sure to have at least 96 Mb free


5. BackUp cartridges > 256 Mbit on a V64Jr./PV-Backup Unit
==========================================================
You can backup cartridges which is bigger than 256 Mbit on your 256Mbit V64Jr. But you can't
test the backup. It is done in 2 "turns". Take a look at the table below to see how many "turns"
is needed with or without Verify..

 w/o Verify:    
   -V64Jr./PV-Backup     256 Mbit  512 Mbit.
   cart. <= 256 Mbit       1 turn    1 turn
   cart. > 256 Mbit	   2 turns   1 turn

 With Verify:
   -V64Jr./ PV-Backup    256 Mbit  512 Mbit.
   cart. <= 256 Mbit       2 turns   2 turns
   cart. > 256 Mbit	   4 turns   2 turns
  

6. E-mail 
=========
If you find any bugs or if you have any ideas, comments or spelling mistakes since english is
not my "first language" then email me @ : rao@mailroom.com

Mails with any kind of ROM / Bootcode request will be ignored!
