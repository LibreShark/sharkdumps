     Well, with the release of the new official Z64 Bios 2.12, Mr. Backup has
finnaly gotten of their asses and put in mempack backup support. Most people
don't see the use in it, but any sports game fan can tell you that unlimited
mempacks is a dream when games like Madden and Griffey take up the whole damn
pak.
                            
     This little utility will convert N64 Dexdrive Saves to Z64 Mempack Saves,
and vice-versa. What's the use in this? Well, since the Dexdrive is a
commercial product put out by a pretty big company, it naturally has quite
a lot of support, more so than an "underground" backup unit. This extra
support means more people are using it, and more people using it means more
N64 Dexdrive Saves out there on the internet (check www.dexchange.net for
lots). They are starting to pop up on quite a few sites, and so I thought it'd
be nice if us Z64 owners could have access to either type of save. I threw in
the z64->dexdrive converter just in case you want to give some Dexdrive
friends of yours one of your saves.

     I've also included the instructions on how to use the mempack backup
feature (since Mr. Backup was obviously so stressed for time that they decided
not to write one up). It's actually a very well done feature, surprisingly
enough.

     Uhhhh... The program itself is pretty self-explanatory, run the
executable, and if your doing Z64->Dex, just input the description you want
to be appended to the dexdrive save, and the filename for the Z64 mempack save
you are converting. It will then output a dexdrive.n64 file, which is a
standard dexdrive save you can use. If you are going Dex->Z64, just input
the filename of the dexdrive save, and it will output z64save.mpk, which is
a standard Z64 Mempack Save... Thats about it...
