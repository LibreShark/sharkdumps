PERFECT TRAINER V1.0b for N64 - coded by iCEMARiO
-------------------------------------------------
Compatible with Action Replay/Gameshark cartridges

What is Perfect Trainer?
It is a new rom that you can upload to your N64 Action Replay or
Gameshark cartridge.  It was specially designed for you to hack
Perfect Dark and Donkey Kong 64.  It also stops the annoying
freezes that you get in Banjo-Tooie while using the old Action 
Replay/Gameshark versions.

Trainer Types:

Perfect Dark PAL
Perfect Dark USA
Perfect Dark JAP (No Code Support in this ver)
Donkey Kong 64 PAL
Donkey Kong 64 USA
Banjo-Tooie UK
Banjo-Tooie USA
Standard Trainer

There is no in-built code generator.  Just use the N64 Utils
to dump memory, train and activate codes.

Installing:

Backup your existing ar3.enc/gs3.enc file from your N64 Utils folder.
Just rename it to ar3backup.enc or something. Then simply extract
the ar3.enc in this archive to the directory of your N64 Utils.
Switch on your N64 and get to the AR/GS main menu. Make sure you have
the suitable cable connected between your Pc and AR/GS comms link.
Run the N64 Utils and go to "Other Utilities" and click Upgrade.
This will start the upgrade procedure which should not take longer
than 30 seconds.  The N64 screen will say "Upgrade Completed" if
successful.

Running:

Switch on the N64 with your AR/GS cart in the N64 and the game on top.
Note: Perfect Trainer is hard-coded to only run games that use the
Zelda keycode.  It will not boot with any other game type.

Uninstalling:

Just rename your backup enc file back to ar3.enc/gs3.enc and repeat
the upgrade procedure when Perfect Trainer is at it's main menu.  This
will put your AR/GS cart back to whatever version your original .enc was.

Try and get the trainer to crash, preferably at the same spot in one
game. I can then investigate the cause and develop a fix.


THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ENDORSED BY DATEL OR NINTENDO.
IT IS IN BETA STAGE AND I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOUR LIFE
SUDDENLY GOES PEAR SHAPED AND YOUR AR/GS CART DIES.
