00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,920
InterAct Accessories welcomes you to the mind

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,199
blowing world of video game enhancements with

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,959
our new GameShark Pro. The GameShark Pro, which

4
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,680
is more technologically advanced than any

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
other game enhancer on the market today, promises

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,639
to take your gameplay to higher levels. It's

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,079
jam packed with great new features. Let's take a look.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,810
The GameShark Pro is loaded with hundreds of

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,810
codes for more than 100 Nintendo 64 titles,

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,970
so you're sure that all the biggest and best games are included.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,450
The GameShark Pro contains enough memory to

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,970
hold hundreds more GameShark codes, and the

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,810
one new feature that makes the GameShark Pro

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,369
the ultimate video game enhancer is its built-in

15
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,830
Code Generator. Code Generator gives you

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,189
the power to produce your own jaw-dropping,

17
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,310
game-winning GameShark codes. So why wait

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,750
for cool new codes when you can produce them yourself?

19
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,629
In this video, you'll discover how the GameShark

20
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,309
Pro will revolutionize your gameplay, arming

21
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:10,190
you with the power to load the most devastating

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,150
codes available, and even showing you how to

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,230
take things a stage further and create your

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,309
own havoc-wreaking codes of destruction.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,919
The GameShark Pro is preloaded with a huge range

26
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,319
of powerful GameShark codes, and using them

27
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,680
couldn't be easier. From the hundreds of Nintendo 64

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,680
titles available on the GameShark Pro, select

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,480
the game you've loaded from the game selection

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,080
menu, then choose the codes you want to tailor

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,720
the game to how you want to play it.

32
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,959
Sometimes certain games won't work with the

33
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,680
GameShark Pro until a special key code is activated.

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,269
Now, here's a list of Nintendo 64 games that

35
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,669
require the use of a key code in order to work

36
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:51,430
with your GameShark Pro. GameShark Pro comes

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,750
preloaded with key codes for all of these games,

38
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,110
and these key codes must be activated before

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,589
the use of the GameShark Pro with one of these titles.

40
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,870
However, since these games will not work with

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,709
the GameShark Pro until the key code has been

42
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,309
activated, you must first insert another game

43
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,589
cartridge into the GameShark Pro in order to

44
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:10,229
access the menu screen and activate the key code.

45
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,380
To do this, simply choose a game that you know

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,220
does not require a key code to work with the GameShark Pro.

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,779
This will be your setup cartridge. Now we shall use GoldenEye.

48
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,580
Since you want to play Zelda 64, go to the Key

49
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,660
Codes menu and select the Zelda 64 key code by

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,139
pushing the analog stick up or down to highlight

51
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,539
the desired code and pressing the A button to

52
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,779
select it. Because we have the Zelda 64 cartridge,

53
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,179
we can select "Yes" at the warning screen and press

54
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,580
the A button. Once the key code is activated,

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,440
turn off your Nintendo 64 system. Remove the

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,679
GoldenEye setup cartridge and insert the game

57
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:48,600
that required the key code, then turn the system on again.

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,320
The GameShark Pro's main menu will appear and you

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,839
can select your codes or start the game. If you

60
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,000
don't have the key code game available, do not

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,399
select "Yes" at the warning screen. If you do

62
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,440
select "Yes", then the next time you use the

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,160
GameShark Pro, the game that you've activated the

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,080
key code for must be inserted. Be warned, the

65
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,160
GameShark Pro will not function until the game

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,750
is inserted into it. As new games are released,

67
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,149
some of them may require new key codes. Be sure

68
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,149
to check out the GameShark website to find out

69
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,389
more information about them. You can also read

70
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,869
more about key codes in the Using Key Codes section

71
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:21,750
of the GameShark Pro instruction manual.

72
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,110
GameShark Pro's Memory Card Manager allows

73
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,830
you to view the contents of any Nintendo 64 memory

74
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,550
card up to 123 pages in size. Follow the simple

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,229
on-screen instructions to load, save, and copy

76
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,639
game save between your memory cards. In addition,

77
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,440
the memory card manager makes it possible to

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,039
copy game saves from the EEPROM of your game

79
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,639
cartridges onto standard memory cards. You

80
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,639
can even trade these saves with friends using

81
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,759
InterAct's N64 DexDrive.

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
The GameShark Pro has a built-in image viewer

83
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,160
that allows you to see graphics stored in the

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,399
system memory the last time the freeze button

85
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,720
of your GameShark Pro was pressed so you can

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,559
view graphics that would not normally be viewed

87
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,320
during a game.

88
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,710
Every keen game player is aware of the increasing

89
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,110
levels of sophistication arriving with each

90
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,510
new game that hits the shelves. Games are becoming

91
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,549
increasingly more challenging not only to

92
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,790
novice players, but to hardcore gamers too.

93
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,269
And no matter how we grade ourselves in terms

94
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,910
of game playing dominance, sometimes we need help.

95
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,109
And to meet this need, many game publishers

96
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:31,350
now embed special effects into their games

97
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,890
that allow you to bend the rules. How can we find

98
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,089
special moves, level skips, and so on, which

99
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,089
are unleashed with the use of codes or fancy

100
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,929
controller moves? GameShark Pro redefines

101
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,929
the rules, letting you set the agenda.

102
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,769
Now get ready, because we're going to teach you

103
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,690
how to play and hack games like a pro using the

104
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,369
GameShark Pro. Please understand that hacking

105
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,329
your own GameShark codes may be a little difficult at first.

106
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,450
After you study this video and actually try

107
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,369
to find codes on your own a few times, you'll

108
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:03,010
start to grasp some concepts of video game coding

109
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,649
and the hexadecimal system used when hacking

110
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,250
with the GameShark codes. How does the GameShark

111
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,010
Pro tilt the odds in your favor? Well, it starts

112
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,519
with the codes. A GameShark code is a special

113
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,119
routine that affects the way a game actually works.

114
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,359
You can select any number of powerful codes

115
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,119
to arm you with the ability to blast your games wide open.

116
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,000
This means you can play a game with infinite

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,519
life or health, infinite ammo, extra vehicles,

118
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,799
extra weapons, and so on. Whether you want to

119
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,920
simply load in codes to enable you to complete

120
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,760
a particular level, then disable them and go

121
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,359
it alone, or if you want to really cheat by playing

122
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,079
an entire game using the codes, the choice is yours.

123
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,850
Before we look at how GameShark codes work, you'll

124
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,690
first need to understand a little of how the

125
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,170
actual engine of the game functions. Every

126
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,609
game, whether it be a fighting, racing, adventure,

127
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:49,170
or shoot 'em up title, has a built-in table of events

128
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,730
that holds the information about gameplay variables.

129
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,130
This area might contain values for the current

130
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,649
level, energy, status, number of lives, and so on.

131
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,250
During gameplay, if, for instance, a life is

132
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,170
lost, then the value at a particular memory

133
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,010
location is reduced to reflect the new lower life value.

134
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,309
Likewise, if the game player moves on to the

135
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,670
next level, then the different value within memory

136
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,109
will be increased accordingly. From this you

137
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,910
can see that you can actually affect the way

138
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,149
a game's engine works. You have the ability to

139
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,230
control these values by preventing the game

140
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,109
engine from changing them in the normal way.

141
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,670
GameShark Pro has the ability to prevent the

142
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,670
values in memory from being modified by the

143
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,950
game and it actually takes control of these

144
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,510
locations by forcing alternative values into them.

145
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,630
This is done by the use of GameShark codes.

146
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,200
A GameShark code is made up of two parts. The

147
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,000
first part is quite simply the address of the

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
memory location that we wish to take control of.

149
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,359
This might be the location that controls lives, for instance.

150
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,559
The second part of the code is the alternative

151
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,000
value that we wish to place there. For instance,

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,399
if this location normally contains only two

153
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,760
lives, then the GameShark code for extra lives

154
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:54,160
might read like this, where the 9 equals 9 lives.

155
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,820
If you simply can't wait for codes for the newest

156
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,140
blockbuster game, then GameShark Pro's built-in

157
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Code Finder is just for you. GameShark Pro

158
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,260
has a powerful Code Generator system which

159
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,260
allows you to find and create your own GameShark codes.

160
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,100
Operation of this feature is quite simple and

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,579
you can soon be producing GameShark codes equal

162
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,220
to those already available. One important

163
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,380
point here is that to use the Code Generator

164
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,380
feature, your Nintendo 64 must be fitted with

165
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,269
a 4-meg RAM expander. Once your console is

166
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,869
equipped with the RAM expander, you're ready

167
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:30,510
to start using the Code Generator. The easiest

168
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,790
way to demonstrate this feature is by example.

169
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:36,029
From GameShark Pro, start the game as you would

170
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,790
normally without any codes enabled. Look for

171
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,910
any elements you would like to change, for example

172
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,709
number of bullets, lives or money. So in this

173
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,230
case we want to make Duke's pistol bullets unlimited.

174
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,429
To go about finding this code, press GameShark's

175
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,029
freeze button which takes you into the In Game menu.

176
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,769
Select Code Generator option. From within

177
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:58,450
this menu screen, select Known Value Search.

178
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:02,809
From the next menu, select Equal To. Here we

179
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:05,209
will enter the value 48 as this represents the

180
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,609
number of bullets Duke has. GameShark tells

181
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:12,410
us there are over 10,000 possibilities, so

182
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,170
we go back into the game. We need to change our

183
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,890
number of bullets. So to do this we fire once.

184
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,489
OK, so we now have 47 bullets. Press the freeze

185
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,739
button again. The Known Value Search menu will appear.

186
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,859
Select Equal To and enter the new value 47.

187
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,299
Now we have only two possibilities, so we select

188
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,219
View Search Results. The codes we have found

189
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,419
are displayed on the left of the screen. To discover

190
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,539
which of these codes controls Duke's bullets,

191
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,979
we need to try them out. So we select one of the

192
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:51,059
codes, then return to the game and fire some bullets.

193
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,369
The code that doesn't allow our number of bullets

194
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:02,250
to be reduced is the correct code. So now throughout

195
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,049
this level, Duke's pistol bullets will remain at 47.

196
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,409
Now we found our code, we need to save it. To do

197
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,169
this, switch your Nintendo console off, then on again.

198
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,650
This takes you back into the GameShark Pro main menu.

199
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,760
Here we're going to Select Cheat Codes. Select

200
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,880
New Game, then Edit Name. Enter the name of the game,

201
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,320
then select it from the game listing.

202
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,280
Select New Code,

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,000
enter a name for the code, then edit the code.

204
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,799
The code you have found appears at the bottom

205
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,280
right hand corner of the screen. Press C-right

206
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,119
to highlight the code, then press A to select it.

207
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,109
Your code will now appear in the edit box. Select

208
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:57,270
Exit and Save, and your code is now permanently

209
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,630
stored in your GameShark.

210
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,549
In some cases, you may not know the value you're

211
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,710
looking for. For example, an energy bar shows no number.

212
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,349
To demonstrate how you would go about finding

213
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,830
an unknown value of this type, we will use Midway's

214
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,150
Mortal Combat Trilogy, where we'll look for

215
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,890
player one's health. From within the Code Generator

216
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,969
menu, select Unknown Value Search, select Start.

217
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,250
This initiates GameShark search and here we

218
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,849
return to the game and lose some of player one's health.

219
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,250
Once we've done this, we press the freeze button

220
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,450
and select Less Than Last.

221
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,049
There are over 1,000,000 possibilities, so

222
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,169
we need to reduce this number to ideally around

223
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,969
20 possibilities, so we return to the game and

224
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:46,969
lose some more health.

225
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,559
Repeat the process as many times as necessary

226
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,960
to obtain a manageable number of possibilities.

227
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,840
In finding this code, we repeated this process

228
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,039
8 times until we had reduced the number of possibilities

229
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,440
down to 26. Then, by process of elimination,

230
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
we deduce which is the code that affects player

231
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,919
one's health. Notice how player one's health

232
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,159
bar doesn't go down.

233
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Then you simply save your newly found code in

234
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
the way shown previously.

235
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,489
So now you've seen how you can find and create

236
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:24,049
your own simple codes. Using the same methods,

237
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,210
you can go on to discover extra characters,

238
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,729
lives, and even create new game scenarios.

239
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,190
We offer several valid sources of the newest

240
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,710
and oldest codes. We have a weekly updated 900

241
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,229
line, 1-900-773-SHARK. There's a free access

242
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:46,549
website www.gameshark.com and we publish

243
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:49,030
a bimonthly newsletter called Dangerous Waters.

244
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:51,429
We also supply codes for your favorite video

245
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,030
game magazines like Game Informer, EGM,

246
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,890
Expert Gamer, and Tips & Tricks. Finally, Prima

247
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,090
Publishing has released two official GameShark

248
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,369
code books that sell in bookstores and game

249
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:03,770
retailers nationwide.

250
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:15,789
Memory cards. Tiny, inconspicuous, small.

251
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,270
With today's video games taking up more and

252
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,750
more space on a memory card, gamers have less

253
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,750
and less space to store all of those favorite game saves.

254
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:26,270
Not to mention the amount of space you lose with

255
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,590
the mountain of memory cards you have accumulated.

256
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,270
Why choose which saves to keep and which to delete

257
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,390
when the DexDrive gives you the ability to store

258
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,150
all of your game saves on the biggest memory

259
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,469
card created: your PC? Use the DexDrive to e-mail

260
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:41,909
your best game saves to friends around the world.

261
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,950
Or download new game saves from the DexDrive website.

262
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,669
All of this power is available to you with the

263
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,950
use of only one memory card. The DexDrive is available

264
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,190
for the Sony PlayStation and for the Nintendo 64.

265
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,429
The DexDrive. It moves mountains.

266
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:06,070
Oh, look how this controller sparkles. OK Janice,

267
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,989
now this is the SuperPad 64 for the Nintendo

268
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,390
64 gaming console. Do you see how it's gold to

269
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,109
match the huge hit Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Oh,

270
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,669
that's just wonderful. You know, Janice, we've

271
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,229
got a gold memory card to match. Oh, would you

272
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:24,070
look at that? This is just perfect for anyone

273
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,390
who really wants to look good with the matching

274
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,710
controller and memory card. Plus, if you've

275
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,830
got the gold Zelda card, you're going to stop traffic.

276
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,830
Now this is a limited edition item, so you better

277
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,150
get them while they're around!

278
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,549
The V3FX racing wheel. Coming soon for use with

279
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,030
the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64. With

280
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,590
the V3FX, you can — and don't forget that you can also —

281
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,469
Actually, you can't do any of that with the V3FX

282
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:55,989
and we strongly recommend that you don't. But

283
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:58,909
what you can do with the V3FX is experience all

284
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,390
the hottest racing games with total control

285
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,030
and ultimate comfort. Two powerful motors

286
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,390
provide vibration feedback, letting you feel

287
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,549
every jolt, turn and impact that games have to offer.

288
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,510
The V3FX Racing wheel for Sony PlayStation

289
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,669
and Nintendo 64. Use it to play games. Not to make

290
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,510
salads.
