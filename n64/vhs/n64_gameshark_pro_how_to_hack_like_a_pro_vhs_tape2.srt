our new GameShark Pro. The GameShark Pro, which

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,559
is more technologically advanced than any

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,920
other game enhancer on the market today, promises

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,520
to take your gameplay to higher levels. It's

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,440
jump packed with great new features. Let's

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:26,959
take a look.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,700
The GameShark Pro is loaded with hundreds of

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,700
codes for more than 100 Nintendo 64 titles,

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,860
so you're sure that all the biggest and best

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,500
games are included. GameShark Pro contains

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,819
enough memory to hold hundreds more GameShark

14
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:45,939
codes, and the one new feature that makes the

15
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,540
GameShark Pro the ultimate video game enhancer

16
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,459
is its built-in Code Generator. Code Generator

17
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,139
gives you the power to produce your own jaw-dropping,

18
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:56,220
game-winning GameShark codes, so why wait

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,619
for cool new codes when you can produce them yourself?

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,220
In this video, you'll discover how the

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,580
GameShark Pro will revolutionize your gameplay,

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,099
arming you with the power to load the most devastating

23
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,059
codes available, and even showing you how to

24
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,139
take things a stage further and create your

25
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,220
own havoc-wreaking codes of destruction.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,819
The GameShark Pro is preloaded with a huge range

27
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,220
of powerful GameShark codes, and using them

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,580
couldn't be easier. From the hundreds of Nintendo 64

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
titles available on the GameShark Pro, select

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,379
the game you've loaded from the game selection

31
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,980
menu, then choose the codes you want to tailor

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,620
the game to how you want to play it.

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,860
Sometimes certain games won't work with the

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,580
GameShark Pro until a special key code is activated.

35
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,180
Now, here's a list of Nintendo 64 games that

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,580
require the use of a key code in order to work

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,339
with your GameShark Pro. GameShark Pro comes

38
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,580
preloaded with key codes for all of these games,

39
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,019
and these key codes must be activated before

40
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,500
the use of the GameShark Pro with one of these titles.

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,779
However, since these games will not work with

42
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,580
the GameShark Pro until the key code has been

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,220
activated, you must first insert another game

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,500
cartridge into the GameShark Pro in order to

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,139
access the menu screen and activate the key code.

46
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,300
To do this, simply choose a game that you know

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,139
does not require a key code to work with the GameShark Pro.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,660
This will be your setup cartridge. Now we shall use GoldenEye.

49
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,500
Since you want to play Zelda 64, go to the Key

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,539
Codes menu and select the Zelda 64 key code by

51
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:30,059
pushing the analog stick up or down to highlight

52
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,460
the desired code and pressing the A button to

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,699
select it. Because we have the Zelda 64 cartridge,

54
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,059
we can select "Yes" at the warning screen and press

55
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,460
the A button. Once the key code is activated,

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,339
turn off your Nintendo 64 system. Remove the

57
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,580
GoldenEye setup cartridge and insert the game

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,500
that required the key code. Then turn the system on again.

59
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,139
The GameShark Pro's main menu will appear and

60
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,380
you can select your codes or start the game.

61
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,460
If you don't have the key code game available,

62
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,139
do not select "Yes" at the warning screen. If you

63
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,580
do select "Yes", then the next time you use the GameShark

64
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,300
Pro, the game that you've activated the key

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,460
code for must be inserted. Be warned, the GameShark

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,100
Pro will not function until the game is inserted into it.

67
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,690
As new games are released, some of them may require

68
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,050
new key codes. Be sure to check out the GameShark

69
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,330
website to find out more information about them.

70
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,449
You can also read more about key codes in the

71
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,649
Using Key Codes section of the GameShark Pro instruction manual.

72
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,009
GameShark Pro's Memory Card Manager allows

73
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,770
you to view the contents of any Nintendo 64 memory

74
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,449
card up to 123 pages in size. Follow the simple

75
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:36,130
on-screen instructions to load, save, and copy

76
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,529
game save between your memory cards. In addition,

77
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:41,369
the memory card manager makes it possible to

78
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,929
copy game saves from the EEPROM of your game

79
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:46,529
cartridges onto standard memory cards. You

80
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,529
can even trade these saves with friends using

81
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,610
InterAct's N64 DexDrive.

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,080
The GameShark Pro has a built-in image viewer

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
that allows you to see graphics stored in the

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,320
system memory the last time the freeze button

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,639
of your GameShark Pro was pressed so you can

86
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,440
view graphics that would not normally be viewed

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,199
during a game.

88
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,639
Every keen game player is aware of the increasing

89
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,000
levels of sophistication arriving with each

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,440
new game that hits the shelves. Games are becoming

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
increasingly more challenging not only to

92
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,640
novice players, but to hardcore gamers too.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,160
And no matter how we grade ourselves in terms

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,760
of game playing dominance, sometimes we need help.

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,040
And to meet this need, many game publishers

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,239
now embed special effects into their games

97
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,799
that allow you to bend the rules. How can we find

98
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,000
special moves, level skips, and so on, which

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
are unleashed with the use of codes or fancy controller moves?

100
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,799
GameShark Pro redefines the rules, letting you

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,799
set the agenda.

102
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,980
Power up with the Turbo RAM and add an extra 4

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,380
megabytes of RAM to the Nintendo 64. The Turbo

104
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,059
RAM allows gamers to enjoy the high resolution

105
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,540
graphics and faster gameplay programmed into

106
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,940
compatible and 64 games. Plus, Turbo RAM is

107
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,820
the only third party RAM pack licensed by Nintendo.

108
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,100
Turbo RAM for Nintendo 64 will be available

109
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,579
in quarter two '99.

110
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,369
Now get ready, because we're going to teach

111
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,290
you how to play and hack games like a pro using

112
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,049
the GameShark Pro. Please understand that hacking

113
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:32,929
your own GameShark codes may be a little difficult at first.

114
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,119
After you study this video and actually try

115
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,040
to find codes on your own a few times, you'll

116
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,679
start to grasp some concepts of video game coding

117
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,320
and the hexadecimal system used when hacking

118
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,920
with the GameShark codes. How does the GameShark

119
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,640
Pro tilt the odds in your favor? Well, it starts

120
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,200
with the codes. A GameShark code is a special

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,760
routine that affects the way a game actually works.

122
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,989
You can select any number of powerful codes

123
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,790
to arm you with the ability to blast your games wide open.

124
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,670
This means you can play a game with infinite

125
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,190
life or health, infinite ammo, extra vehicles,

126
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,470
extra weapons, and so on. Whether you want to

127
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,549
simply load in codes to enable you to complete

128
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,390
a particular level, then disable them and go

129
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,029
it alone, or if you want to really cheat by playing

130
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,790
an entire game using the codes, the choice is yours.

131
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,510
Before we look at how GameShark codes work, you'll

132
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,350
first need to understand a little of how the

133
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,859
actual engine of the game functions. Every

134
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,260
game, whether it be a fighting, racing, adventure,

135
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,820
or shoot 'em up title, has a built-in table of events

136
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,380
that holds the information about gameplay variables.

137
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,779
This area might contain values for the current

138
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,299
level, energy, status, number of lives, and so on.

139
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,899
During gameplay, if, for instance, a life is

140
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,820
lost, then the value at a particular memory

141
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,660
location is reduced to reflect the new lower life value.

142
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,420
Likewise, if the game player moves on to the next

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,299
level, then the different value within memory

144
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:47,769
will be increased accordingly. From this you

145
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,570
can see that you can actually affect the way

146
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,809
a game's engine works. You have the ability to

147
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,890
control these values by preventing the game

148
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,769
engine from changing them in the normal way.

149
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,329
GameShark Pro has the ability to prevent the

150
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,329
values in memory from being modified by the

151
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:02,609
game and it actually takes control of these

152
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:05,170
locations by forcing alternative values into them.

153
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,730
This is done by the use of GameShark codes. A GameShark

154
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,570
code is made up of two parts. The first part is quite

155
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,609
simply the address of the memory location that

156
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:15,829
we wish to take control of. This might be the

157
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:18,029
location that controls lives, for instance.

158
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,230
The second part of the code is the alternative

159
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,630
value that we wish to place there. For instance,

160
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,070
if this location normally contains only two

161
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,429
lives, then the GameShark code for extra lives

162
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:30,790
might read like this, where the 9 equals 9 lives.

163
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,470
If you simply can't wait for codes for the newest

164
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,790
blockbuster game, then GameShark Pro's built-in

165
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,829
Code Finder is just for you. GameShark Pro

166
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,950
has a powerful Code Generator system which

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,910
allows you to find and create your own GameShark codes.

168
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:49,750
Operation of this feature is quite simple and

169
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,230
you can soon be producing GameShark codes equal

170
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,869
to those already available. One important

171
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,029
point here is that to use the Code Generator

172
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:00,070
feature, your Nintendo 64 must be fitted with

173
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,950
a 4-meg RAM expander. Once your console is

174
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,549
equipped with the RAM expander, you're ready

175
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:07,149
to start using the Code Generator. The easiest

176
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,429
way to demonstrate this feature is by example.

177
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,679
From GameShark Pro, start the game as you would

178
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,440
normally without any codes enabled. Look for

179
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,559
any elements you would like to change, for example

180
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,399
number of bullets, lives or money. So in this

181
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,880
case we want to make Duke's pistol bullets unlimited.

182
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,079
To go about finding this code, press GameShark's

183
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,200
freeze button which takes you into the In game

184
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,440
menu. Select Code Generator option. From within

185
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,119
this menu screen, select Known Value Search.

186
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,440
From the next menu, select Equal To. Here we

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
will enter the value 48 as this represents the

188
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,280
number of bullets Duke has. GameShark tells

189
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,039
us there are over 10,000 possibilities, so

190
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,840
we go back into the game. We need to change our

191
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,520
number of bullets. So to do this we fire once.

192
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,159
OK, so we now have 47 bullets. Press the freeze

193
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,409
button again. The Known Value Search menu will appear.

194
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,530
Select Equal To and enter the new value 47.

195
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,969
Now we have only two possibilities, so we select

196
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,849
View Search Results. The codes we have found

197
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,090
are displayed on the left of the screen. To discover

198
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,169
which of these codes controls Duke's bullets,

199
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,609
we need to try them out. So we select one of the

200
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:27,729
codes, then return to the game and fire some bullets.

201
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,030
The code that doesn't allow our number of bullets

202
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,909
to be reduced is the correct code. So now throughout

203
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:41,789
this level, Duke's pistol bullets will remain at 47.

204
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,070
Now we found our code, we need to save it. To do

205
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,830
this, switch your Nintendo console off, then on again.

206
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,309
This takes you back into the GameShark Pro main menu.

207
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,419
Here we're going to Select Cheat Codes. Select

208
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,580
New Game, then Edit Name. Enter the name of the game,

209
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,979
then select it from the game listing.

210
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,940
Select New Code,

211
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,659
enter a name for the code, then edit the code.

212
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,460
The code you have found appears at the bottom

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,940
right hand corner of the screen. Press C-right

214
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,780
to highlight the code, then press A to select it.

215
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,780
Your code will now appear in the edit box. Select

216
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,940
Exit and Save, and your code is now permanently

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,299
stored in your GameShark.

218
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,219
In some cases, you may not know the value you're

219
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:45,380
looking for. For example, an energy bar shows no number.

220
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,979
To demonstrate how you would go about finding

221
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,500
an unknown value of this type, we will use Midway's

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,780
Mortal Combat Trilogy, where we'll look for

223
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,559
player one's health. From within the Code Generator

224
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,640
menu, select Unknown Value Search, select Start.

225
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,919
This initiates GameShark search and here we

226
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,520
return to the game and lose some of player one's health.

227
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,880
Once we've done this, we press the freeze button

228
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
and select Less Than Last.

229
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,719
There are over 1,000,000 possibilities, so

230
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,840
we need to reduce this number to ideally around

231
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,640
20 possibilities, so we return to the game and

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,679
lose some more health.

233
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,229
Repeat the process as many times as necessary

234
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,630
to obtain a manageable number of possibilities.

235
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,510
In finding this code, we repeated this process

236
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,710
8 times until we had reduced the number of possibilities

237
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,109
down to 26. Then, by process of elimination,

238
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,390
we deduce which is the code that affects player

239
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,590
one's health. Notice how player one's health

240
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,789
bar doesn't go down.

241
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,429
Then you simply save your newly found code in

242
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,669
the way shown previously.

243
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,159
So now you've seen how you can find and create

244
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,719
your own simple codes. Using the same methods,

245
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,880
you can go on to discover extra characters,

246
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,400
lives, and even create new game scenarios.

247
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,080
Last year we unveiled what many deemed the peripheral

248
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,559
of the show, the DexDrive. The concept behind the DexDrive

249
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,440
is a simple yet brilliant one. Gamers can transfer

250
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Nintendo 64 or PlayStation game saves to their

251
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,760
PC's hard drive where they can be safely stored

252
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,559
and backed up. The unique patented DexPlorer

253
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,440
software program allows gamers to easily manage

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,200
their game saves with retrieve, copy, and other

255
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
editing functions. When combined with the

256
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,080
Internet, that's where the DexDrive really begins

257
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,239
to shine. With game saves now on PC, they can

258
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,840
be uploaded to and downloaded from the Internet

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,080
and e-mailed to other DexDrive users. InterAct

260
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
supports the DexDrive with a website that

261
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,520
provides gamers with a plethora of game saves

262
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,679
to download, the opportunity to post their

263
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,479
own game saves, as well as the DexCussion board,

264
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,880
a place to discuss video game topics, and request

265
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
specific game saves. DexDrive for Nintendo

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,359
64 and the PlayStation are available now.

267
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,760
If you fancy yourself as a real game guru and

268
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,640
GameShark Pro can be connected to a PC, simply

269
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,520
by using a standard printer lead connected

270
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
to the parallel port of any PC. Printer leads

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,200
are available from wherever you buy your computer accessories.

272
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,599
Simply connect one end to the printer port of

273
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,239
your PC and the other end to the comms port of your

274
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,280
GameShark Pro. Then simply download the special

275
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,719
SharkLink software from the GameShark website

276
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,440
www.gameshark.com. You now have the power to

277
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,520
generate codes using your PC.
