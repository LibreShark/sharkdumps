Introduction
------------

Congratulations! You have purchased the ultimate game enhancer for the N64® game system. With the GameShark, you can take your gaming to new levels of fun and excitement. The GameShark allows you to add codes and enhancements to your N64® games that you never dreamed possible. Find new levels in your favorite games. Gain infinite lives. Modify the game to your specifications.

The GameShark is completely menu-driven. You don't need to add codes letter by letter, number by number, every time you turn your machine on. All you need to do is highlight the enhancement you want to use, and start playing games like never before!

And in a ground-breaking method of enhancement, you can save codes to the GameShark's built-in memory! Enter a code once, and that's the last time you'll have to punch it in! This is the future of game enhancement, and it's in your hands!

Instructions for start-up
-------------------------

Switch off your N64®, and plug the GameShark into the cartridge port. Make sure the GameShark is pushed firmly into place, and that the GameShark label is facing the front of your N64®. Now push the game cartridge that you want to play firmly into the socket on the top of the GameShark. Make sure that the label of the game cartridge is also facing to the front of your N64®.

**Never** under any circumstances should you **plug any** cartridge or accessory into the N64® with the power on. Doing so could result in damage to either the N64®, the GameShark, or both.

Switch on your console and GameShark is ready to go. The LED display on the front of the unit will count down from 5 to O to indicate that GameShark is ready for use.

1. Start Game With Selected Codes <br>This option starts the game using any enhancements selected from the **Select Cheat Codes** menu.
2. Start Game Without codes <br>This option starts the game without any enhancements. The game will play as it normally would.
3. Cancel - return to previous menu <br>This option takes you to the opening menu. Use the up and down arrows on the direction pad to highlight one of these options. Press the "A" button to select.

Button "A" will toggle the enhancement on and off. You can activate almost any combination of enhancements. NOTE: some codes do not work in conjunction with other codes.

When you are finished selecting the desired enhancements, press the "B" button to return to the previous menu or press the "start" button to go to the **Start Game Options** menu.

Adding New Enhancements
-----------------------

As new games are released, you will want to add new enhancements for those games to the GameShark's menu. These codes could be ones that you have seen in magazines, gotten from our 900 number, found in the GameShark newsletter, _Dangerous Waters_, or from our World Wide Web page, _Surfing With the Sharks_. (www.gameshark.com). We're making sure that you always have the newest codes for the hottest games available to you, and that they are always within easy reach.

Entering New Games
------------------

To enter new codes, simply go to the **Select Cheat Codes** menu where existing games and enhancements are listed. Highlight the "New Game" selection at the top of the menu, and use the "A" button to select it. This will take you to the New Game Edit screen. This is the screen where new games can be entered. You will be presented with a text entry box. Use the direction pad to highlight letters from the letter box to spell the name of the game you are entering enhancements for. Use the "A" button to select a letter.

When you have finished entering the name of the new game, press the "B" button. After entering and saving the game name, select the game from the "SELECT GAME" menu. Next, select the "NEW CODE" option

New Code Description
--------------------

By selecting the New Code Description option, you will be presented with a new text entry box. This is where you will give your new enhancements descriptions. You will probably want to name your new enhancements something similar to what they do. For example, you may want to name a new enhancement "Infinite Lives." Enter the name as you did when entering the New Game Name. Press the "B" button and save when you are finished. You can use the "C-upper" button to change between upper and lower case characters.

Enhancement Entry

Each code will include numbers and letters. Again, use the direction pad to highlight a letter or number, and press the "A" button to select that letter or number. Continue until the entire code is entered. Individual codes can sometimes be quite long, so a bit of concentration may be required. If you make a mistake while entering a code, don't panic! use the "L" trigger button to **backspace** and use the "R" for **space**.

Default Box
-----------

The status of the Default Box can be toggled off and on by highlighting the box and pressing the "A" button. With the Default Box set to ON, the enhancements for that particular game will always be active when you select that particular game from the menu. When the Default Box is set to OFF, you will need to activate the enhancements each time you start that particular game.

After you have entered and saved the new enhancement for this game, press the "B" button to return to the **Select Cheat Codes** menu. You can now select the game and enhancement you entered to test them out.

Exiting Back to the Main Menu
-----------------------------

To exit the memory card manager and return to the main menu simply press the "B" button.

Using Keycodes
--------------

Some games will require a "Keycode", or specific activation code, in order to use any enhancements. These keycodes may be shared by some games, whilst other games will require their own specific keycode. Not all games will require a keycode, but you'll know that one is required if the game will not load when the GameShark is present. The GameShark currently contains keycodes for any games that require them. As new games are released, any new keycodes required will be provided through our website or our Technical support Department. once you receive the new keycode from InterAct, follow the directions listed below to activate it properly.

WARNING: Do not activate any keycodes unless you have the game available. Entering a keycode without the game will cause the GameShark to lock up until that game is inserted.

How to get started
------------------

Games that require keycodes are not compatible with the GameShark until the keycode is activated. For this reason, you will need to insert another game first, to get into the GameShark menus and activate the keycode. Choose a game that you know works fine with the GameShark to use as your "set-up cart". Once the keycode is activated, you will need to turn off your Nintendo 64 system, remove the set-up cart and insert the new game requiring the code, and then power up again to play.

---

Adding new keycodes
-------------------

With a standard game, or " set-up cart" inserted, go into the main menu and press both triggers " L" & " R" to get into the keycode menu. Push the analog stick all the way down until a blank key- code is displayed, then press the "A" button to select. You can now enter a new keycode and comment. This only has to be entered once, and will be stored in the GameShark for future use. once the keycode has been added, follow the instructions for
activating it.

Activating a keycode
--------------------

While in the main menu, press triggers " L" & " R" to go into the keycode menu. In this menu, any current keycodes will be shown, along with a comment or description. Select a keycode by pushing the analog stick up or down to highlight the code wanted, and pressing "A" to select it. At this point, a warning is displayed to confirm that you have the game associated with the selected key- code. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE GAME AVAILABLE, DO NOT PRESS THE "A" BUTTON TO SELECT IT. IF YOU DO SELECT THE KEYCODE, THEN THE NEXT TIME YOU POWER UP THE GAMESHA RK, THE GAME MUST BE PRES ENT. BE WARNED - IF THE GAME IS NOT PRESENT, YOUR

GAMESHARK WILL LOCK-UP UNTIL THE GAME IS INSERTED. If you have the game, and are prepared to activate the keycode, follow the on- screen instructions and then turn your Nintendo 64 system off. If you do not have the game, press any button on your controller to deactivate this selection.

Starting the game with keycode activated
----------------------------------------

Once you have activated the keycode and turned the system off, remove the set-up cart and insert the game for which the keycode was activated. Then power up and use the GameShark with enhancements, as usual. You can add new enhancements for the game, activate them and deactivate them as needed.

---

Please note that the keycode system is a "one shot" operation. This means that after you've finished playing a game using keycodes and then switched off your system, it will return to the factory settings. You will have to repeat the activation procedures every time you use one of these games requiring keycodes. It is best to use a game cartridge which you know works with GameShark's factory settings as a standard set-up cart.

Getting New Enhancement codes
-----------------------------

There are four ways you can get new codes for your GameShark. One way is to join _Dangerous Waters_, the exclusive members-only source for the latest codes. Full details on joining are on the membership card enclosed. You will also be given the option to access _Surfing With The Sharks_, (www.gameshark.com) our free World Wide Web Page.
