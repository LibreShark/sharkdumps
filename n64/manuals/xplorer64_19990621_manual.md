Adding New Cheats
-----------------

You can add up to 10’000 cheats to Xplorer 64. These can added in several ways. The most common method will be from the cheats and tips sections of games magazines, through our own dedicated Codes Hotline or the Official Xplorer Website. You can also add cheats using the PC X-Link software*, Special Format Memory cards, even from your friends Xplorer. Remember you can also use Action Replay™ and GameShark™ cheat codes, but Xplorer codes will not work on other cheat cartridges.

You will notice the cheats are split into three areas;- The Game Name, The Cheat Description and The Cheat Code.

**_Your first step is to enter the game name._**

1.  Select “Select Cheats” from the Main Menu.
2.  At the top of the list you will see “Add New Game”. Move the pointer to this and press A.

---

3.  You can now enter the name of the game. Using the controller, select each of the letters(or spaces etc.) in turn and press the A button to spell out the game name. Pressing the L and R buttons will move the cursor left and right and pressing the left C button will delete a character.
4.  When you have finished entering your game name, press Start or select “OK”. If you wish to abandon the entry, select “Can” to cancel the operation.

**_Now you should enter the cheat description (e.g. Infinite Lives)._**

1.  Highlight the Game Name you have just entered and press the right C button.
2.  Move to the “Add New Description” and press A.
3.  You can now enter the Cheat Description in the same way as you entered the game name.
4.  Press Start or select “OK” to complete the procedure.

**_Finally, you can now enter the Cheat Code itself;_**

1.  Go to the game Name you have entered and press the right C button.
2.  Now move the pointer to the Cheat Description you have just entered and press the right C button.
3.  Now move the pointer to “Add Cheat Code” and press the A button
4.  Again, you can enter the code in the same manner as above, but you can only enter the numbers 0 to 9 and letters A-F. These are the only figures the code can consist of.
5.  Enter the sequence of 12 characters ensuring that you enter the code correctly. If you make a mistake, you will need to amend the code as it will not work correctly.

When you leave the cheat screen, your new codes will be stored in Xplorer’s memory. You can delete the cheats at a later date if required. Turning the power off does not delete the cheats.

You can activate your new cheat as described in “Selecting Cheat Codes”.

You do not need to enter the game name again if you add another cheat at a later date. Simply highlight and view the current cheats for that game and simply add a new description and code within that game-names cheats.

_IMPORTANT_ <br>
Starting with Special Games.
----------------------------

Some games require the Xplorer and console to be started differently than normal. In the past, other cheat cartridges have required you to send your cheat cartridge back to the manufacturer to be updated - Xplorer 64 has a unique key-code system which allows access to any existing and forthcoming games for entering your cheat codes.

If, after following the above instructions “Connecting your Xplorer 64" you are faced with a blank screen, you will probably need to change the Boot Mode on your Xplorer 64.

Special Game Boot Modes
-----------------------

Xplorer 64 comes initially with 4 Boot Modes that currently cover all existing game titles. These 4 modes cover the following games;

    Mario, Lylat Wars and MOST other games    Boot Mode 1 (LED ON)
    1080 Snowboarding, Banjo Kazooie          Boot Mode 2
    Yoshi's Story                             Boot Mode 3
    Zelda: Ocinara of Time                    Boot Mode 4

To change the Boot Mode.
------------------------

Follow the procedure “Connecting Your Xplorer 64”. If you are faced with a black screen;

1.  With the power still On, press the button on the Xplorer once, the LED will flash once.
2.  Turn the power off and wait for 4 seconds.
3.  Power up your console.

If the game does not work, repeat the above procedure - each press of the button will switch to the next mode. This will cycle through each of the current Boot Modes. Boot Mode 1 is shown with the LED constantly ON.

To return to Boot Mode 1 (LED ON) from any other mode, press and hold the button for approx. 4 seconds.

At the time of Xplorer 64’s release, all games will work in one of the above modes.
