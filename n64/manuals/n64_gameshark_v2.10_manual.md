INTRODUCTION
------------

Congratulations! You have purchased the ultimate game enhancer for the N64“ game system. With the GameShark, you can take your gaming to new levels of fun and excitement. The GameShark allows you to add codes and enhancements to your N64“ games that you never dreamed possible. Find new levels in your favorite games. Gain infinite lives. Modify the game to your specifications.

The GameShark is completely menu-driven. You don’t need to add codes letter by letter, number by number, every time you turn your machine on. All you need to do is highlight the enhancement you want to use and start playing games like never before!

And in a groundbreaking method of enhancement, you can save codes to the GameShark’s built-in memory! Enter a code once and that’s the last time you’ll have to punch it in! This is the future of game enhancement, and it’s in your hands!

INSTRUCTIONS FOR START-UP
-------------------------

Turn off your N64“, and plug the GameShark into the cartridge port. Make sure the GameShark is pushed firmly into place, and that the GameShark label is facing the front of your N64“. Now push the game cartridge that you want to play firmly into the socket on the top of the GameShark. Make sure that the label of the game cartridge is also facing to the front of your N64“.

Never, under any circumstances should you plug any cartridge or accessory into the N64“ with the power on. Doing so could result in damage to the N64“, the GameShark, or both.

Switch on your console and GameShark is ready to go. The LED display on the front of the unit will count down from 5 to 0 to indicate that the GameShark is ready for use.

---

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
--------------------

After the opening screen, you will see the main menu screen for the GameShark. The main menu is composed of 4 items.

The Main Menu
-------------

1) **Start Game**
2) **Select Cheat Codes**
3) **Memory Card Manager**
4) **Keycode Entry**

**Use the up and down arrows on the direction pad to highlight one of these items. Press the “A” button to select. Use the “B” button to return from the selected screen.**

Some games require a special Keycode in order to work with the GameShark. For instructions on Keycodes see the “Keycode Entry” section later in this manual.

## 1. Start Game

Choosing “Start Game” takes you to the Start Game Options menu. You will then have three options:

1. Start Game With Selected Codes <br>This option starts the game using any enhancements selected from the Select Cheat Codes menu.
2. Start Game Without Codes <br>This option starts the game without any enhancements. The game will play as it normally would.
3. Cancel - return to previous menu <br>This option takes you to the opening menu. Use the up and down arrows on the direction pad to highlight one of these options. Press the “A” button to select.

## 2. Select Cheat Codes

This option takes you to the built-in list of games currently supported by the GameShark. Games are listed alphabetically. Use the up and down keys on the direction pad to highlight the desired game and press the “A” button to select. Button “B” will return you to the previous menu.

---

Once you’ve selected a game, a full list of enhancements will appear on the screen for that game. Use the up and down arrow keys on the direction pad to highlight each individual enhancement. Button “A” will toggle the enhancement on and off. You can activate almost any combination of enhancements. NOTE: A maximum of 15 codes may be enabled at one time. Experimentation will help you determine the best combinations of codes for each game. Activated enhancements will be highlighted in green. When you are finished selecting the desired enhancements, press the “B” button to return to the previous menu or press the “Start” button to go to the Start Game Options menu.

Adding New Enhancements
-----------------------

As new games are released, you will want to add new cheats for those games to the GameShark’s menu. These codes could be ones that you have seen in magazines, acquired from our 900 number, found in the GameShark club, Dangerous Waters, or from our World Wide Web page. We’re making sure that you always have the newest codes to the hottest games available to you and that they are always within easy reach.

Entering New Games
------------------

To enter new codes, simply go to the Select Cheat Codes menu where existing games and enhancements are listed. Highlight the “New Game” selection at the top of the menu, and use the “A” button to select it. This will take you to the New Game Edit screen. This is the screen where new games can be entered. You will be presented with a text entry box. Use the direction pad to highlight letters from the letterbox to spell the name of the game you are entering enhancements for. Use the “A” button to select a letter.
When you have finished entering the name of the new game, press the “B” button. After entering and saving the game name, select the game from the “SELECT GAME” menu. Next, select the “NEW CODE” option.

New Code Description
--------------------

By selecting the New Code Description option, you will be presented with a new text entry box. This is where you will give your new enhancements descriptions. You will probably want to name your new enhancements something similar to what they do. For example, you

---

may want to name a new enhancement “Infinite Lives”. Enter the name as you did when entering the New Game Name. Press the “B” button and save when you are finished. You can use the “C-upper” button to change between upper and lower case characters. Use the “L” trigger button to backspace and use the “R” trigger for space.

Enhancement Entry
-----------------

By selecting the blue Code Entry section in the left hand corner, you will produce a small text entry box. This is where you will enter the actual Enhancement Code. Each code will include a combination of 12 numbers and letters. Again, use the direction pad to highlight a letter or number, and press the “A” button to select that letter or number. Continue until the entire code is entered. Individual codes can sometimes be quite long, so a bit of concentration may be required. If you make a mistake while entering a code, don’t panic! You can use the L or R trigger buttons to move forward and back to re-enter a number or letter. Simply go to the letter or number you entered wrong, and select the correct letter or number to replace it. The new letter or number will simply overwrite the old one.

Default Box
-----------

The status of the Default Box can be toggled between three options, ON, OFF and BUTTON by highlighting the box and pressing the “A” button. With the Default Box set to ON, the enhancements for that particular game will always be active when you select that particular game from the menu. When the Default Box is set to OFF, you will need to activate the enhancements each time you start that particular game. When the Default Box is set to BUTTON, the code will only activate when the GameShark button is pressed.

After you have entered and saved the new enhancement for this game, press the “B” button to return to the Select Cheat Codes menu. You can now select the game and enhancement you entered to test them out.

Your new enhancement has been saved to the menu of the GameShark and will remain there until you decide to delete it. You can add additional enhancements to any game simply by highlighting the New Code line and pressing the “A” button and going through the entry steps above.

## 3. Memory Card Manager

The memory manager allows you to view the contents of any memory card up to 1998 blocks in size. Follow the simple on screen instructions to load, save and copy between memory cards. In addition it is possible to copy the game saves from inside your game cartridge onto memory cards.

Introduction to the Memory Card Manager
---------------------------------------

At the main menu of the GameShark select “Memory Card Manager” and press the “A” button, you will now be in the Memory Card Manager.

Memory Card Manager Screen
--------------------------

The GameShark will now present you with two blue boxes. Select either Game Card, save files stored on the cartridge, or Controller, save files stored on the memory card in the controller. At the bottom of the blue boxes the amount of space in use will be displayed after the “PAGES:” heading. The amount of space available will be displayed after the “FREE:” heading.

Copying and Deleting Files
--------------------------

Once the save file has been selected, highlighted in white, press the “A” button to copy the file. The directional arrow beside the word “COPY” will point in the direction of the destination of that file, if the instruction reads “A:<-COPY” the file will be copied from the right box into the left box. To delete a file, select the unwanted file and press the “Z” button. At this point a confirmation screen will appear, select either “YES” or “NO" using the directional control and press the “A” button.

Smart Card Port
---------------

The GameShark has a unique Smart card reader/writer slot at the rear of the unit. This slot will support a range of Smart cards including Ram, ROM and Flash ROM cards. These cards offer features including special game cheats and memory card support. Watch out for these exciting products as they become available for your GameShark.

---

Full instructions for the use of this expansion port will be included with the new products.

LED Indicator
-------------

GameShark has a built-in LED display. This feature will also be fully utilized with future products available for the Smart Card Port of your GameShark.

GS Button
---------

This feature is used to enable specific codes. If the GS button is required for the code it will be noted in the code description, as in “Press GS Button for 99 Coins.” This button may also be utilized with Smart Card products available soon for GameShark.

Exiting Back to the Main Menu
-----------------------------

To exit the memory card manager and return to the main menu simply press the “B” button.

## 4. Keycode Entry

Some games will require a “keycode”, or specific activation code, in order to use any enhancements. These keycodes may be shared by some games, whilst other games will require their own specific keycode. Not all games will require a keycode, but you’ll know that one is required if the game will not load when the GameShark is present. The GameShark currently contains keycodes for any games that require them. As new games are released, any new keycodes required will be provided through our website or our Technical Support Department. Once you receive the new keycode from InterAct, follow the directions listed below to activate it properly.

WARNING: Do not activate any keycodes unless you have the game available.

Entering a keycode without the game will cause the GameShark to lock up until that game is inserted.

---

How to get started
------------------

Games that require keycodes are not compatible with the GameShark until the keycode is activated. For this reason, you will need to insert another game first, to get into the GameShark menus and activate the keycode. Choose a game that you know works fine with the GameShark to use as your "set-up cart". Once the keycode is activated, you will need to turn off your Nintendo 64 system, remove the set-up cart and insert the new game requiring the code, and then power up again to play.

Adding new keycodes
-------------------

With a standard game, or "set-up cart" inserted, go into the main menu and select the Keycode Entry option. Push the analog stick all the way down until a blank keycode is displayed, then press the “A” button to select. You can now enter a new keycode and comment. This only has to be entered once, and will be stored in the GameShark for future use. Once the keycode has been added, follow the instructions for activating it.

Activating a keycode
--------------------

While in the main menu, select the Keycode Entry option. In this menu, any current keycodes will be shown, along with a comment or description. Select a keycode by pushing the analog stick up or down to highlight the code wanted, and pressing “A” to select it. At this point, a warning is displayed to confirm that you have the game associated with the selected keycode. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE GAME AVAILABLE, DO NOT PRESS THE “A” BUTTON TO SELECT IT. IF YOU DO SELECT THE KEYCODE, THEN THE NEXT TIME YOU POWER UP THE GAMESHARK, THE GAME MUST BE PRESENT. BE WARNED - IF THE GAME IS NOT PRESENT, YOUR GAMESHARK WILL LOCK-UP UNTIL THE GAME IS INSERTED. If you have the game, and are prepared to activate the keycode, follow the on-screen instructions and then turn your Nintendo 64“ system off. If you do not have the game, press any button on your controller to deactivate this selection.

---

Starting the game with keycode activated
----------------------------------------

Once you have activated the keycode and turned the system off, remove the set-up cart and insert the game for which the keycode was activated. Then power up and use the GameShark with enhancements, as usual. You can add new enhancements for the game, activate them and deactivate them as needed.

Please note that the keycode system is a "one shot" operation. This means that after you've finished playing a game using keycodes and then switched off your system, it will return to the factory settings. You will have to repeat the activation procedures every time you use one of these games requiring keycodes. It is best to use a game cartridge which you know works with GameShark's factory settings as a standard set-up cart.

Getting New Codes
-----------------

There are four ways you can get new codes for your GameShark. One way is join Dangerous Waters, the exclusive members-only source for the latest codes. Full details on joining are on the membership card enclosed. You may also visit our Surfing With the Sharks website at www.gameshark.com. We also have a “900” number dedicated to GameShark codes.

The number to the GameShark Hotline is 1-900-773-SHARK (75275). The call costs $1.29 per minute, and you must be 18 years old or have your parent’s permission to call.

You can check your favorite videogame magazines for codes. Each month, we will have codes in different magazines. As you can see, there will never be a shortage of codes for the GameShark.

Trouble Shooting
----------------

If you are having problems with your GameShark, make sure the cartridge is plugged in properly. If you are having problems with codes, make sure you have entered the code or codes properly. If you are still having problems, you can call our Technical Support department, but please DO NOT call this number for codes, as they are not available through Tech Support. Maintenance and servicing should be done by
