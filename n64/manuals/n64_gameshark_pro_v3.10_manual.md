**Instruction Manual for GameShark™ Pro**     <br>
**For use with the Nintendo® 64 game system** <br>
**Version 3.1**

INTRODUCTION
------------

Congratulations! You have purchased the ultimate game enhancer for the Nintendo® 64 game system that will take your gaming to new levels of fun and excitement. The GameShark Pro allows you to add codes and enhancements to your Nintendo 64 games that you once thought were impossible. Find new levels in your favorite games, gain infinite lives and modify the game to your specifications.

The GameShark Pro is completely menu-driven. You don't need to add codes letter by letter, or number-by-number, every time you turn your machine on. All you need to do is highlight the enhancement you want to use and start playing games like never before!

This GameShark Pro is also more technologically advanced than any other game enhancer on the market today. It promises to revolutionize your gameplay-arming you with the power to load the most devastating codes available and even showing you how to take things a stage further by creating your own havoc-wreaking codes of destruction.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
-------------------

### GameShark (GS) Button

Also known as the GS Button. This button is used to enable specific GameShark codes and access the Code Generator so that you can create your own GameShark codes. If the GS button is required to activate a code, it will be noted in the code description, as in "Press GS Button For 99 Coins."

**NOTE: The GS button not only activates codes but gives you access to the Code Generator as well. You WILL NOT be able to use the "Press GS Button for..." codes if you turned the Code Generator on.**

### LED Display

The GameShark Pro has an LED display that tells you when the GameShark Pro is ready for use.

### How to Hack Like A Pro Video

This 5-minute video accompanies the GameShark Pro and will show you how to search for and create your own GameShark codes using the Code Generator. Watch this video and you will definitely be on your way to becoming a code hacking genius.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR START-UP
-------------------------

**NOTE: Peel off the yellow WARNING sticker before using the GameShark Pro.**

1.  Turn off your N64, and plug the GameShark Pro into the cartridge port. Make sure the GameShark Pro is pushed firmly into place, and that the GameShark Pro label is facing the front of your N64.

2.  Place the game cartridge that you want to play firmly into the socket on top of the GameShark Pro. Make sure that the label of the game cartridge is facing towards the front of your N64.

3.  Now insert a game controller into Controller Port #1.

4.  Turn your N64 on. The LED display on the GameShark Pro will count down from the number 5. The Main Menu will appear on the TV screen, indicating that the GameShark Pro is ready for use. If you do not reach the Main Menu, or the LED does not show a count down, then turn the N64 off, make sure that the GameShark Pro is properly inserted, then turn the system on again.

**NOTE: If the GameShark Pro does not start, check to see if the game you want to play requires a key code. Some games require a special Key Code in order to work with the GameShark Pro. For information about Key Codes, read the Using Key Codes section of this manual.**

Never, under any circumstances, plug the GameShark Pro or a cartridge into the N64 while the power is on. Doing so could result in damage to the N64, the GameShark Pro, or the cartridge.

MAIN MENU
---------

The Main Menu is composed of these 5 items:

1.  Start Game
2.  Select Cheat Codes
3.  Options
4.  Key Codes
5.  Memory Card Manager

Move up and down on the direction pad (D-Pad) or the analog stick of the controller to highlight one of these items, and press the A button to select. Use the B button to exit from the selected screen.

### START GAME

This selection takes you to the Start Game Options menu. You will then be presented with two or more options. Press up and down on the D-pad or the analog stick to highlight an option and press the A button to select it.

**Option 1: Start Game With Selected Codes** <br>
This option starts the game using the enhancements codes selected from the Select Cheat Codes menu. You will see this option only after you have activated codes for a game and you are ready to start playing.

**Option 2: Start Game Without Codes** <br>
This option starts the game without any enhancement codes. The game will play as normal.

**Option 3: Code Generator ON/OFF** <br>
This option gives you the ability to access the Code Generator and search for GameShark codes while playing a game. Read the Code Generator section in this manual for more information. Press the A button to toggle between ON and OFF.

**NOTE: To use the Code Generator, you must have a 4MB Expansion Pak inserted into your Nintendo 64 game system. If the Expansion Pak is not inserted, this option will not appear on screen.**

**Option 4: Cancel** <br>
This option takes you back to the Main Menu.

### SELECT CHEAT CODES

This option takes you to the built-in list of Nintendo 64 titles currently supported by the GameShark Pro. All titles are listed alphabetically. Press up or down on the D-pad or the analog stick to highlight the desired game and press the A button to select it. The B button will return you to the Main Menu. The L button will scroll the list of games up and R button will scroll the list down.

The bottom of the Select Cheat Codes screen will display the highlighted game, the number of enhancement codes that are currently active for that game, and the percentage of storage space available within the GameShark Pro’s memory.

Once you've selected a game, a full list of enhancement code descriptions will appear on the screen for that game. These descriptions represent a code. Press up or down on the D-pad or analog stick to highlight an individual code. The A button will toggle the codes on and off. You can activate almost any combination of enhancements. Active codes are highlighted in blue. To delete a code, press the Left C button. When you are finished activating your desired codes, press the Start button to go to the Start Game Option menu.

**NOTE: The GameShark Pro only allows 15 active enhancement codes at one time. However, if you install a 4MB Expansion Pak Product into the Nintendo 64, you can activate hundreds of enhancement codes at one time.**

**NOTE: Some games require an access code labeled as (M), which means that this code "ALWAYS MUST BE ON." This code will be highlighted in green at all times or the GameShark Pro will not be able to load the game properly. There may be future titles that require this access code. If this code is required on new games, it will be made available with codes for that game.**

---

#### WHERE TO FIND NEW ENHANCEMENT CODES

As new games are released, you will want to add new codes for those games to your GameShark Pro. You can find new codes at:

- The Official GameShark World Wide Web page **http://www.gameshark.com**
- Various videogame magazines
- The Official GameShark Newsletter **Dangerous Waters**
- The Official Code Hotline **1-900-773-SHARK**. This call costs $1.29 per minute, and you must be over 18 years old or have your parent's permission to call.

We're making sure that the newest codes to the hottest games are available and easy to find.

#### ADDING NEW GAMES TO THE GAMESHARK PRO

To add new codes to your GameShark Pro, you must first add the title of the game to the GameShark Pro, IF that title does not already exist in the built-in list of games. To add a new game title:

1.  Go into the Select Cheat Codes menu and press the Z-Trigger.
2.  Highlight Add New Game and press the A button to select.

You can also go to the Select Cheat Codes menu and select "New Game" at the top of the list.

The New Game Edit screen will appear. Now you can enter the title of a new game. You will be presented with 3 or 4 options:

**Option 1: Edit Name** <br>
Highlight this option and press the A button on your controller. You will be presented with a box filled with Letters, Numbers and Symbols. Use the directional pad or analog stick to highlight characters within the letterbox to spell the name of the game that you want to add to the GameShark Pro. Use the A button to select a character.

Use the Z-Trigger button to toggle between upper and lower case letters. To backspace the cursor 1 character, press the L button. To move the cursor forward 1 space, press the R button. To delete the entire name, press the Left C button. When you have finished entering the name of the new game, press the B button.

**Option 2: Detect Game** <br>
The GameShark Pro will search for the title of the inserted game cartridge, and place it in the box located at the top of the screen. The title it finds will replace any name that you have placed into that box. Sometimes your GameShark Pro may not find the title of your game. If it does not, use the Edit Name option and enter the title.

**Option 3: Exit and Save** <br>
This saves the title into the built-in list of games found in the Select Game list and returns you to that list. This option will appear only after you have created a name for a game.

**Option 4: Exit and Discard** <br>
This deletes the name you entered or the title the GameShark Pro found, then returns you to the Select Game list. Once you have added the title of your game to the Select Game list, find the title you created by using the L and R buttons to scroll up and down the list. Highlight the name of the game you just created and press the A button. The Select Cheat Codes screen will appear. It is now time for you to add your codes to the GameShark Pro.

#### ADDING NEW CODES TO THE GAMESHARK PRO

In the Select Cheat Codes menu, highlight New Code and press the A button. This will take you to the New Code Description screen. In this screen, you will be presented with a new box filled with characters. This is where you will give each of your new codes a description. You will probably want to name your new enhancement codes something similar to what they do.

For example, if a code gives you a large number of lives, you may want to name the code "Infinite Lives". Enter the description of the code as you did earlier when you entered the title of the new game. When you are finished, press the B button. If you exit without entering a new code description, "No Cheat Name" will appear and be the default description of that code. To change this, simply highlight that description and press the A button.

---

#### ENTERING CODES INTO THE GAMESHARK PRO

After you have entered a description and pressed the B button, 2 more boxes will appear on screen. The box on the left, with the dots, is the Code Entry box. The box on the right is the Options box. Use the D-pad or analog stick to navigate between the boxes. A yellow border will appear around the box that you are currently using.

Select the Code Entry box and press the A button. This is where you will input your new code(s) for the game you just selected from the GameShark Pro's list of games. A small text entry box will appear. Use this box to choose the letters and numbers within the actual cheat code. Most codes will be a one line combination of 11 or 12 numbers and letters, but some codes may be 2 lines or longer. Use the D-pad or the analog stick to highlight a letter or number, and press the A button to select that letter or number.

Continue until the entire code is entered. Individual codes can sometimes be quite long, so a bit of concentration may be required. If you make a mistake while entering a code, don't panic! You can use the L or R buttons to move backward and forward and re-enter a number or letter. Simply move the cursor to the letter or number that you entered incorrectly, and select the correct letter or number to replace it. The new letter or number will overwrite your mistake.

After you have entered the new code for this game, press the B button to return to the Options menu. You'll be able to select these options:

**Option 1: Default On** <br>
This allows you to keep this code on at all times. So every time you start the GameShark Pro, this one code will ALWAYS be activated. Use the A button to toggle between on and off status.

**Option 2: Exit and Save** <br>
This will save your new code to the specific game listed at the top of this menu and then exit you to the Select Cheat Codes menu. From there you can enter more enhancement codes for your game by selecting New Code or activate your new code IF the code isn't always on by default.

**Option 3: Exit and Discard** <br>
This will delete the code that you just entered and then exit you to the Select Cheat Codes menu. From there you can enter more enhancement codes for your game by selecting New Code.

Once you have entered and saved you new codes, you can start to use them. If you chose Option 2, your new codes will be saved to the built-in list of games within the GameShark Pro and will remain there until you decide to delete them. Remember to activate your codes before you start the game if their default is OFF. All activated codes are highlighted in Blue.

You can add more codes to any game simply by selecting the game and highlighting the New Code line and pressing the A button and going through the code entry steps described above.

**NOTE: Each code is usually only one line, and each code should have 1 description. Do not make the mistake of entering a group of separate GameShark Pro codes into one description. Make a description for each code you add, unless a code is more than 1 line long.**

#### DELETING A CODE

If you want to delete a code, simply highlight the description of the code and press the left C button. A message will appear asking if you are sure you want to delete the code. Use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight Delete and press the A button.

To cancel, simply highlight cancel and press the A button.

#### SAVING GAMESHARK CODES TO MEMORY CARD

This feature allows you to save a set of GameShark codes to a Nintendo 64 memory card. You can either give the card to a friend, so that they can load the codes into their GameShark Pro or you can use InterAct's DexDrive and e-mail or post the codes to the Internet. To save a set of codes onto a memory card:

1.  Insert a memory card into Controller #1.

2.  Highlight Select Cheat Codes from the Main Menu. Press the A button.

3.  In the Select Game menu, highlight the game who's codes you wish to save.

---

4.  Press the Z-Trigger button to display the Options menu.

5.  Highlight Save Codes To Memory Card and press the A button. All codes for the selected game will be saved to the memory card in Controller #1.

6.  You can store only one set of codes on a memory card at a time. For example, if you saved Battle Tanx codes to a memory card and then saved Mortal Kombat Trilogy codes to the same memory card, your Battle Tanx codes will be ERASED and REPLACED with the Mortal Kombat Trilogy codes.

**NOTE: GameShark Pro code saves are always labeled GAME-SAVEDAT.**

#### LOADING CODES FROM A MEMORY CARD TO A GAMESHARK PRO

This feature allows you to load codes from a memory card to your GameShark Pro so that you don’t have to manually enter the codes yourself. Even if the game’s title does not exist in the GameShark Pro's built-in list of games, this feature will automatically add the game, plus the codes, to your GameShark Pro. To load a set of codes from your memory card to your GameShark Pro:

1.  Insert the memory card that contains the GameShark codes into Controller #1.

2.  Highlight Select Cheat Codes from the Main Menu. Press the A button.

3.  In the Select Game menu, press the Z-Trigger button to display the Options menu.

4.  Highlight Load Codes From Memory Card then press the A button.

5.  The Save/Load screen will appear. If the codes are on the memory card in Controller #1, a message will tell you that the codes were found.

6.  Highlight Add Codes and press the A button. To cancel this procedure, highlight cancel and press the A button.

7.  If you selected Add Codes, the codes on your memory card will be added to your GameShark Pro.

**NOTE: You can only load N64 game codes into a N64 GameShark Pro. You cannot load codes into a GameShark with a version number lower than 3.0.**

**Task 2: Scroll Background On/Off** <br>
The background can either scroll or remain stationary. Press the A button to toggle On and Off.

**Task 3: Menu Scrolling On** <br>
This option makes the menus either scroll or flash off the screen when you move to a new menu. Press the A button to toggle between On and Off.

**Task 4: Sound Enabled/ Disabled** <br>
Press the A button to toggle the sound On and Off.

**Task 5: Exit** <br>
Exits the Options menu and takes you back to the Main Menu.

### USING KEY CODES

Sometimes, certain Nintendo 64 games will not work with the GameShark Pro until a special "key code" is activated. Here is a list of Nintendo 64 games that require the use of a key code in order to work with your GameShark Pro at the time this manual was printed (April 1999):

---

**The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time**        <br>
**Yoshi's Story**                                   <br>
**Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.** <br>
**Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside**                    <br>
**F Zero X**                                        <br>
**Diddy Kong Racing**                               <br>
**Cruis'n World**                                   <br>
**Banjo-Kazooie**                                   <br>
**1080° Snowboarding**

The GameShark Pro comes preloaded with keycodes for all of these games, but these key codes must be activated BEFORE you use the GameShark Pro with one of these titles. Since these games will not work with the GameShark Pro until the key code has been activated, you must first insert another game cartridge into the GameShark Pro in order to access the menu screen, and then activate that game's key code.

#### ACTIVATING A KEY CODE

Imagine that you want to play one of the games listed above that need a key code, like The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. To activate the key code, simply:

1.  Find a Set-Up Cartridge. A Set-Up Cartridge is ANY Nintendo 64 game that you know DOES NOT require a key code to work with the GameShark Pro. All games that are not mentioned in the list above do not need a key code to work with the GameShark Pro. Let's use Mortal Kombat Trilogy as the Set-Up Cartridge for this example.

2.  Insert the GameShark Pro into your Nintendo 64 system. Also, plug a controller into Controller Port #1.

3.  Connect the Set-Up Cartridge to the GameShark Pro. Turn on your Nintendo 64.

4.  From the Main Menu screen, highlight Key Codes and press the A button.

5.  Since you want to play The Legend of Zelda, find the Zelda key code by pushing the D-pad or analog stick up or down and highlighting the Zelda code. Press the A button to select it.

6.  A warning message will appear and ask if you actually have the key code game available. IF you actually have the Zelda game, you can highlight YES at the Warning screen, then press the A button. If you do not have the key code game, press the B button to exit the warning screen.

**NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE KEY CODE GAME AVAILABLE, DO NOT SELECT YES AT THE WARNING SCREEN. IF YOU DO SELECT YES, THEN THE NEXT TIME YOU USE THE GAMESHARK PRO THE KEY CODE GAME MUST BE CONNECTED TO THE GAMESHARK PRO.**

**BE WARNED - IF YOU ACTIVATED A KEY CODE, THE GAMESHARK PRO WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY UNTIL THAT KEY CODE GAME IS CONNECTED TO IT.**

7.  After you answer yes to the warning, the key code will be activated. Turn off your Nintendo 64 system.

8.  Remove the Set-Up Cart (in this case, Mortal Kombat Trilogy) and insert the game that requires the key code (The Legend of Zelda), then turn the N64 on again. The GameShark Pro's Main Menu will appear and you can select codes and start the game.

As new games are released, some of them may require new key codes. Be sure to check out the GameShark website (www.gameshark.com) to find out which games will need new key codes.

#### ADDING NEW KEY CODES TO THE GAMESHARK PRO

When a new game is released and it needs a key code, you'll have to get the key code from the GameShark website and then add the key code to your GameShark Pro. To add a new key code to the GameShark Pro:

1.  Use a Set-Up Cartridge to get into the Main Menu screen. Highlight Key Codes and press the A button.

2.  Push the D-pad or analog stick up or down, until you arrive at the Blank Key Code. This key code will be all Zeros. Press the A button to edit this code.

3.  You can now use the D-pad or analog stick to enter the new key code characters. You will then be asked if this is the correct code. If so, highlight YES and press the A button.

---

4.  When you are ready to play the new game that required the new key code you just entered, follow the instructions above that describe how to ACTIVATE A KEY CODE.

If you enter in a wrong key code, a red warning message will tell you that the key code is "Incorrect".

Press the Z-Trigger button to set the key codes to the factory default. The factory default key code is the Mario World 64 and Others.

**NOTE: You only have to create a key code once. Your new key code will stay in the memory of the GameShark Pro. Remember, you must use a Set-Up cartridge and follow the activation procedures before you play any of the games that require a key code.**

### MEMORY CARD MANAGER

The Memory Card Manager gives you the ability to format, view or copy the contents of any Nintendo 64 memory card. In addition, the Memory Card Manager allows you to copy the game saves from your N64 game cartridge to a memory card.

At the Main Menu of the GameShark Pro, highlight Memory Card Manager and press the A button. Upon entering the Memory Card Manager, the GameShark Pro will attempt to check for any memory cards inserted into a controller connected to the N64 system. This will take only a few seconds.

#### USING THE MEMORY CARD MANAGER

The GameShark Pro will now present you with two boxes. Use the D-pad or the analog stick to navigate between the two boxes.

Inside each box, you will see a listing of all controllers that are connected to the N64 that have a memory card in them. The GameShark Pro can read or copy information from any of these controllers, if they have a memory card inserted.

You may also notice a GamePak listing. This represents the Nintendo 64 game cartridge that you have inserted into the GameShark Pro. This option allows you to copy game saves to or transfer game save from a game cartridge.

When the game saves appear in a box, the bottom of each box will show you how many blocks a highlighted save is and how many blocks or space is left on the memory card. You must use Controller #1 to navigate through the Memory Card Manager and to execute a command. You will also see these commands:

    A button:     Selects a game save and copies a highlighted save
    B button:     Exits to the previous menu
    L button:     Formats the highlighted memory card
    R button:     Re-Reads the highlighted memory card
    Z-Trigger:    Deletes the highlighted save on a memory card

#### COPYING GAME SAVES

**To copy game saves from one memory card to another memory card**

1.  Connect a controller into controller port #1 and controller port #2. Insert a memory card into each controller.

2.  Highlight the Memory Card Manager option in the Main Menu. Press the A button.

3.  Using the D-pad or the analog stick on Controller #1, highlight the phrase "Controller 1" in the box on the left of the Memory Card Manager. Press the A button and the saves on memory card #1 will appear.

4.  Now highlight "Controller #2" in the box on the right using the D-pad or analog stick on Controller #1. Press the A button. The saves on memory card #2 will appear as well.

5.  Using the D-pad or analog stick on Controller #1, highlight a game save that you want to copy, then press the A button. A progress bar will appear and the save will be copied onto the memory card in Controller #2. To delete a game save, highlight the save then press the Z-Trigger button.

6.  Repeat these steps until you have copied all the game saves that you want.

7.  Repeat the steps until you have copied all the game saves that you want.

#### DELETING GAME SAVES

To delete game saves from either a memory card or a game cartridge, highlight the game save that you want to delete then press the Z-Trigger button. Once you have deleted a save, there is no way to retrieve it.

#### FORMATTING A MEMORY CARD

**NOTE: Formatting a memory card will delete all the game saves on a memory card.**

1.  Connect a controller into controller port #1 and insert a memory card into the controller.

2.  If your card is a multi-paged, make sure that you turn to the correct page before entering the Memory Card Manager.

3.  Turn on the N64 system and highlight the Memory Card Manager option in the Main Menu. Press the A button.

4.  Using the D-pad or the analog stick, highlight the phrase "Controller 1" in the box on the left. Press the A button and the saves on memory card #1 will appear.

### THE CODE GENERATOR

The terms "Training" and "Hacking" have been used throughout the gaming industry to describe the process of finding enhancement codes within a game. For several years, we have been hacking GameShark codes for our customers and providing them on the GameShark website, in the Dangerous Waters newsletter, and other means. We will continue to do so, but in addition, we have updated the new GameShark Pro to include built-in Code Generator software for independent code hacking. Users can now try their hand at finding codes for infinite lives, weapons, secrets, etc.!

The following section of this manual explains the new Code Generator feature, including a detailed FAQ section of common questions. Additionally, the "How to Hack Like a Pro" video shows examples of the Code Generator in use. After watching this video, if you still have questions or want to share your findings, the new discussion board on the GameShark website **(www.gameshark.com)** offers an excellent forum for communication with others within the GameShark hacking community.

Here is some information that you should know before using the Code Generator:

1.  **DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS FEATURE, QUESTIONS ON HOW TO HACK CODES USING THE CODE GENERATOR WILL NOT BE ANSWERED BY INTERACT’S CONSUMER SERVICES DEPARTMENT.** However, we’ve included as much information as possible for users to try hacking codes on their own. We encourage everyone to give it a try and to use the discussion board on the GameShark website to talk to others.

2.  We must warn that this is an advanced feature, and will not be for everyone. A general knowledge of programming code is recommended, but not required, and some practice will most likely be needed to develop good hacking skills.

3.  Watch the "How To Hack Like A Pro" video that comes with the Game Shark Pro.

#### USING THE CODE GENERATOR

Before you use the Code Generator, you must:

1.  Have a 4MB Expansion Pak installed into your Nintendo 64 game system.

2.  Turn the Code Generator on BEFORE you start the game that you will find codes for. You'll see the ON/OFF option after selecting the Start Game option in the Main Menu.

3.  Press the GS button on the GameShark Pro to get to the Code Generator menu while playing a game. From there, you simply highlight the Code Generator option and press the A button.

The Code Generator menu contains these options:

**Option 1: Return To Game** <br>
Exits the Code Generator menu and returns the user to the game.

**Option 2: Exit To Main Menu** <br>
Returns the user to the In-Game Menu.

**Option 3: Known Value Search** <br>
Allows the user to search the game for all addresses with a specific value. This is useful for finding codes for ammo, money, etc. Read below for further instructions.

**Option 4: Unknown Value Search** <br>
For the advanced hacker, this allows the user to search the game and locate addresses that do not use specified values. This search is long because the user may have to search many areas of memory. Luckily, once the desired address is found, most other relevant addresses are in the same basic area of memory. This search is useful for finding codes for health meters, etc. See below for further instructions.

**Option 5: 8 or 16 Bit Search** <br>
Allows you to perform a search for a value between 0-255 (8-bit) or for a value that is more than 255, but less than or equal to 65535 (16-bit).

**NOTE: If your game crashes or locks up during any of the following procedures, simply turn your Nintendo 64 game system off, then turn it on again and start over.**

#### KNOWN VALUE SEARCH

A known value search is used to find codes when you know the value of what you are looking for, like "6 Lives" or "100 Bullets." To start a known search, highlight the Known Value Search option in the Code Generator menu and press the A button.

The Known Value Search menu appears and contains these 4 commands:

**Option 1: Return To Game** <br>
This will return you to the game.

**Option 2: Exit To Main Menu** <br>
This takes you back to the In-Game Menu.

**Option 3: Reset Code Generator** <br>
This will clear the Code Generator of all other searches that were previously performed. Use this option when you are re-starting a search.

**Option 4: Equal To** <br>
This lets you perform a search for a value that you specify. If you are in 8-bit mode, the value range that you can search for is from 0 to 255. If you are in 16-bit mode, the value range is from 0 to 65535.

##### How To Perform A Known Value Search

STARTING A SEARCH

1.  In the Main Menu, highlight Start Game and press the A button.

2.  Turn the Code Generator ON and start the game without any codes. Press the Start button to start the game.

3.  Decide which variable you want to find a code for. Since you will be doing a known search, choose a variable that you can see in the game. For example, we can find the infinite Tek Arrows in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. This is easy because you start the game with 30 Tek Arrows.

FINDING CODE VALUES

4.  Once the game has started, press the GS button on the GameShark Pro. Highlight Code Generator and press the A button.

5.  Decide if you want to perform a 8 or 16-bit search.

6.  Highlight the Known Value search and press the A button.

7.  Highlight Equal To and press the A button. Insert the number of arrow you start with (30), and press the A button.

8.  An orange status bar will appear, and then a message will appear telling you how many Possibilities Remain.

9.  Press the Start button on the controller to return to the game.

10. Shoot an arrow. You should have 29 arrows left. Press the GS button on the GameShark Pro.

11. Highlight Equal To and press the A button. Enter 29 into the Equal To box. Press the A button.

---

12. The orange bar will appear and then a message will tell you how many code Possibilities Remain.

##### VIEWING YOUR SEARCH RESULTS

13. When you get to a manageable number of possibilities (10 or less), highlight View Search Results and press the A button to see the list of possible codes that control the variable that you were searching for.

14. Once inside the menu, the box on the right will contain a list of code possibilities found by the Code Generator. Use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight a code, then press the A button to copy the code to the Active Codes box on the left. Press Start to return to the game.

15. When testing an active code, to easily recognize which code controls the variable that you are looking for, choose only one code at a time. You will know when you are testing the correct code when the variable that you were looking for remains at the same value, even when you try to decrease it. So, in this example, you will know you have the correct code when you shoot a Tek Arrow, and the number of arrows never decreases.

16. If the code is not correct, simply go back into the View Search Results option and use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight the wrong code, then press the Left C button to remove it from the Active Codes list.

17. Now highlight the next code in the Possibilities box and press the A button to copy it to the Active codes list. Press the Start button to return to the game and see if this is the correct code.

18. Continue this process until you find a code that does not make the variable that you are searching for decrease.

##### EDITING AN ACTIVE CODE

Editing a code allows you to change the value of an active code that you find using the Code Generator. For example, if the Infinite Tek Arrow code you found in Turok is: 80128e0f 0015, where the "015" means you have 15 arrows, you can edit the value of that code to 80128e0f 0099, so now you will have 99 arrows. To edit an active code, simply:

1.  Select the View Search Results option to see the active code.

2.  Use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight the active code.

3.  Press the Right C button to edit the code.

4.  The Edit Value menu will appear. Use the D-pad or analog stick to select a number and change its value. When you have found the desired value, press the A button to select or press the B button to exit.

5.  Press the Start button to return to the game.

**NOTE: You can use this same procedure to edit codes that you find using an Unknown Value Search.**

##### COPYING ACTIVE CODES TO THE GAMESHARK PRO

If you would like to copy a new code from the Active Codes list and add it to the GameShark Pro:

1.  Turn the N64 system OFF, then turn it on again.

2.  Highlight and select the Select Cheat Codes option.

3.  Now select a game or create a New Game and enter the code description as you normally would. (Read the **Adding New Games** and **Adding New Codes** sections of this manual)

4.  Once in the Edit Code section, a menu will appear with the contents of the Active Codes list. To access the Active Codes list, press the Right C button. Use the D-Pad or analog stick to highlight which code you would like to copy. To copy the selected code, press the A button.

**NOTE: You can use this same procedure to copy active codes that you find using an Unknown Value Search.**

##### TIPS FOR PERFORMING A KNOWN VALUE SEARCH

1.  If at any time you feel that you have made an error, select the Reset Code Generator option and start over.

---

2.  If the number of possibilities is less than 10, you may want select the View Search Results option, unless you can get to a lower number of possibilities. This will display all of the current memory addresses that have your desired value.

#### UNKNOWN VALUE SEARCH

An unknown search is performed when the variable you are looking for has no known numeric values. This search is perfect for health meters or air supply meters. To start an unknown search, highlight the Unknown Value Search option in the Code Generator menu and press the A button.

The Unknown Value Search menu will appear and contain these 4 commands:

**Option 1: Return To Game** <br>
This will return you to the game.

**Option 2: Exit To Main Menu** <br>
This takes you back to the In-Game Menu.

**Option 3: Reset Code Generator** <br>
This will clear the Code Generator of all other searches previously performed. Use this option when you are re-starting a search.

**Option 4: Start** <br>
This will start the search for an unknown value.

##### How To Perform An Unknown Value Search

STARTING A SEARCH

1.  In the Main Menu, highlight Start Game and press the A button.

2.  Turn the Code Generator on and press the Start button to begin the game.

3.  Decide which unknown value you want to find codes for. As an example, we will find the Infinite Health code for Player #1 in Mortal Kombat Trilogy.

4.  Press the GS button. The In-game menu will appear. Highlight the Code Generator option and press the A button.

FINDING CODE VALUES

5.  Highlight the Unknown Value Search option and press the A button.

6.  Highlight the Start option and press the A button.

7.  An orange status bar will appear indicating that the search has started. When the bar disappears, press the Start button on the controller to return to the game.

8.  In the game, lose some of the health in your health bar. After you lost a little bit of health, press the GS button.

Once you go back into you're the Code Generator, you will find these options:

**Option 1: Return To Game** <br>
This will return you to the game.

**Option 2: Exit To Main Menu** <br>
This takes you back to the In-Game Menu.

**Option 3: Reset Code Generator** <br>
This will clear the Code Generator of all other searches that were performed previously. Use this option when you are re-starting a search.

**Option 4: Greater Than Last** <br>
Searches for values that are now greater than the last search you performed.

---

**Option 5: Less Than Last** <br>
Searches for values that are now less than the last search you performed.

**Option 6: Different To Last** <br>
Searches for values that are now either more than or less than the last search you performed.

**Option 7: Equal to Last** <br>
Searches for values that are still the same as the last search you performed.

9.  Highlight the Less Than Last option and press the A button. The orange status bar will appear indicating that a search for values that are now less than the previous search has started.

10. When the bar disappears, you will see the amount of possible codes that remain. If the number of possibilities is too high, press the Start button to return to the game.

11. In the game, lose a little bit more of your health. Once you lose health, immediately press the GS button on your GameShark Pro.

12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 until you have a manageable amount of code possibilities (10 or less).

VIEWING YOUR SEARCH RESULTS

13. When you get to a manageable number of possibilities (10 or less), highlight View Search Results and press the A button to see the list of possible codes that control the variable that you were searching for.

14. Once inside the menu, the box on the right will contain a list of codes possibilities found by the Code Generator. Use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight a code, then press the A button to copy the code to the Active Codes box on the left.

15. When testing an active code, choose only one code at a time to easily recognize which code controls the variable that you were looking for. You will know when you are testing the correct code when the variable that you were looking for remains at the same value, even when you try to decrease it.

16. If the code is not correct, simply go back into the View Search Results option and use the D-pad or analog stick to highlight the wrong code, then press the Left C button to remove it from the Active Codes list.

17. Now highlight the next code in the Possibilities box and press the A button to copy it to the Active codes list. Press the Start button to return to the game to see if this is the correct code.

18. Continue this process until you find a code that does not make the variable that you were searching for decrease.

##### TIPS FOR PERFORMING AN UNKNOWN VALUE SEARCH

1.  If at any time you feel that you have made an error, select the Reset Code Generator option and begin again.

2.  If the number of possibilities is less than 10, you may want select the View Search Results option, unless you can get to a lower number of possibilities. This will display all of the current memory addresses that have your desired value.

3.  If you run out of time, or if your character dies before you have completed your search, your health meter may INCREASE in the next round. If this happens, do not stop your search! Simply choose the GREATER THAN LAST option the next time you press the GS and continue your search.

### MEMORY EDITOR

The Memory Editor allows the user to view the programming of a Nintendo 64 game. The programming is displayed on the left side of the screen, and the corresponding text on the right. To toggle the cursor between the number on the left and the text on the right press the Z-Trigger button. To scroll through the information, press up or down on the D-pad. Use the L button to page up and R button to page down. To alter either the numbers on the left or text on the right, use the Up C button to increase and the Down C button to decrease a character. You may press the B button to exit this feature at any time.

NOTE: Using the known address of a code may uncover new codes. For instance, if you know the memory address (code) for one type of weapon in a game, increasing or decreasing the values of nearby addresses may uncover vital game data, such as other weapons or items. This strategy relies mainly on luck, so results will definitely vary from

game to game.

#### ADVANCED FEATURES

The Memory Editor also has a menu of advanced options. Press the A button while in the Memory Editor to view these options:

**Option 1: Go to Address** <br>
This feature allows the user to input a specific address and then view it. Use the D-pad or analog stick to enter the desired memory address, then press the A button to go to the address. Press the B button to go back to the In-Game Menu.

**Option 2: Text Search** <br>
The Text Search allows you to search for programmer's cheats, passwords, Easter eggs or other text clues to the game. Use the D-pad to input text, as well as to change letters. Press the D-pad left or right to go to the next letter. Once the text is entered, press the A button. The address displayed will be the first match to the text. If you would like to continue searching, select the "Text Search" option and press the A button. The search will continue from the current address.

If the text you entered is not found, this message will appear: "String Not Found, Press B". If you press the B button, you will be taken to the Memory Editor screen.

**NOTE: Most games that have programmers cheats store the information in the same area, so once the first cheat is found, the others should be in that area. Key words to search for are ’credit' and 'extra', as these are common words used in many cheats.**

**Option 3: Back To Editor** <br>
Returns to the Memory Editor feature.

**Option 4: Return To Game** <br>
Exits the GameShark Pro In-Game Menu and re-enters the game.

### A NOTE FROM THE INTERNET HACKERS

One thing game training (hacking) requires is a great deal of patience. Take it from Kato, CodeBoy and Code Master, do not expect to be a hacking genius overnight. We come across things we have not seen before every once in awhile ourselves. With experience, you will be able to crack just about any game code a programmer can throw at you.

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS HACKING WITH THE GAMESHARK PRO

Go to The Hackery at **www.gameshark.com** to find more Frequently Asked Questions regarding hacking with the GameShark Pro.

**Q: What is the difference between the numbers and letters?**

A: The numbering system that the GameShark Pro uses is called hexadecimal (hex). Instead of the standard decimal system (0 - 10), the GameShark Pro reads 0 through f (a = 10, b = 11...f = 15). Here is an example of 1 - 20 in Decimal, then in Hex:

    Decimal:    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,....
    Hex:        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,....

---

It is of great assistance to have a calculator that can convert from decimal to hexadecimal.

**Q: What does the code itself mean?**

A. The first eight digits are the address in the RAM (Random Access memory) of the Nintendo 64 and the last four digits are the values of that address. So, as an example, 80123456 xxxx: 80123456 is the address of the code in the RAM and xxxx is the value (where xxxx can range from 0000 [decimal = 0] to ffff [decimal = 65,535])

**Q: What is the difference between a Known Value Search and an Unknown Value Search?**

A: A Known Value Search is a search where the numeric value is easily identified. Examples of known values would be scores in sports games or lives in some adventure games. An Unknown Value Search is a where there is no numerical value given. An example of an unknown value would be a health meter in fighting games.

**Q: How do I search for a known value?**

A: An example of hacking a known value is the game BattleTanx from 3DO:

**Hacking Tip**: Make sure that:

1.  You have a 4MB Expansion Pak inserted into your Nintendo 64.
2.  The 'Codes Are ON' option is listed under the 'In Game Menu'; if not, it may cause problems with your hacking searches.
3.  The Code Generator has been turned on.

After entering the game, take the initial reading (i.e. when you see that you have 70 bullets in your tank).

**Hacking Tip**: Doing two searches when the value is zero may cause the search to fail since zero is a common value in game code using the Known Value Search.

Using the Equal To function, set the value to 70.

**Hacking Tip**: The value for the Equal To function is in hexadecimal for ease of us.

Now a listing of the amount of current possibilities is displayed on the screen.

Return to the game and shoot a bullet from your tank. Do another equal to search using the current value of your remaining ammo (69). Continue to search as your ammo decreases until the number of possible codes is 10 or less.

Now comes the fun part, determining which code is the correct one. As you gain experience training and hacking games, this process becomes easier. Go into the View Search Results to see the code. In this case, the code should be:

Unlimited Ammo: 80135760 0001

**Q: How do I test the code that I have found?**

A: To test a code, highlight it in the Possibilities list on the left side of the View Search Results screen and press the A button. This will move it to the Active Codes list on the right side of the screen. Now, return to the game and continue to play. The ammo that you were searching for should never decrease. It should remain at the value you set in the Active Codes list.

**Q: How do I search for an unknown value?**

A: Searching for an unknown value is quite different from searching for a known value. This example will also be performed with Mortal Kombat Trilogy title by Midway. We will look for Player 1's Infinite Health Meter.

**Hacking Tip**: Enter the game and again make sure that:

1.  You have a 4MB Expansion Pak inserted into your Nintendo 64.
2.  The 'Codes Are ON' option is listed under the In Game Menu; if not, it may cause problems with your hacking searches.
3.  The Code Generator has been turned on.

Next, select Unknown Value Search from the Code Generator menu. Press the Start button.

---

Allow your character to lose some of his health. Now, make a Less Than Last search, because your character’s health meter has gone down; therefore the value of the health meter has dropped.

**Hacking Tip**: Occasionally, the inverse is true; i.e. as the health meter drops the value is actually increasing. This occurs very rarely on only a few games.

Return to the game and repeat the above step, allowing some more of your health to go down. If your character is killed during the round, at the start of the next round, perform a Greater Than Last search after his/her health is restored to full.

**Hacking Tip**: After you have taken a few searches, take a reading at the start of a round, then allow your character to be killed and do an Equal To Last. Search at the start of the following round, as long as the health meter is full, you know that the values are equal. This will greatly narrow down the amount of possibilities.

Continue to search until the amount of possibilities is 10 or less.

Again, we are at the point that you need to select which code is the correct one. For Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the Player 1 infinite health code is:

8016984D 00a6

To test the code, follow the same instructions above.

**Q: After I find a code, will other codes generally be in the same area?**

A: Most of the time, if you have found one code, others will be in the same area. This is a general rule and does not necessarily apply to every game.

**Q: The code I have selected is not working. What's wrong?**

A: There are a couple of possibilities. The first is that the code you have selected is the wrong one. Even though some codes match all the search criteria you input (Greater Than, Less Than, Equal To) does not mean that it is in fact the code you are looking for. Also, the code may not be under the Active Code List. It needs to be there and the 'Codes Are ON' option should be active under the In Game Menu.

If the code is incorrect, try the search again. If the codes you have are not working, you may have searched in the wrong area or have the wrong code/s turned on. Write down codes that you know do not work, as well as the ones that do work.

**Q: What is the difference between "8-Bit Search" and "16-Bit Search" in the Code Generator screen?**

A: An 8-bit search is a search for a value between 0-255 if the value you are looking for is above this and less than or equal to 65535, then use the 16-bit search. 8-bit codes start with the numbers "80", while 16-bit codes start with the numbers "81".

TROUBLE SHOOTING
----------------

If you are having problems with your GameShark Pro, make sure the cartridge is plugged in properly. If you are having problems with codes, make sure you have entered the correct code or codes properly. Some games require an access code labeled as (M), which means that this code "ALWAYS MUST BE ON." This code will be highlighted in green at all times or the GameShark Pro will not be able to load the game properly. There may be future titles that require this access code. If this code is required on new games it will be made available with codes for that game. If you are still having problems, you can call our Technical Support department at (410) 785-4064. **Please DO NOT call this number for codes, as they are not available through Tech Support.**
