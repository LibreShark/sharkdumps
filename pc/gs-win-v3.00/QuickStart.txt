Installation
------------
To begin installing GameShark for Windows onto your PC insert the GameShark for Windows product CD into your computer's CD-ROM drive and wait a few seconds for

The InstallShield Wizard will guide you through the rest of the
installation - just follow the on-screen instructions.

Running GameShark
-----------------
To run GameShark for Windows click on Start Menu / GameShark For Windows / GameShark PC.
Once the splash screen has displayed you will be at the "Main Menu" page.

Navigation Bar
--------------
You can use the navigation bar at the top left of the window to quickly
get to any part of GameShark for Windows.

 o  The left and right arrows work just like the Back and Forward 
    buttons in your web browser.

 o  The letter groups (A-D E-L M-T and U-Z) will take you directly to
    the Games Page for games with names that begin with those letters.

 o  The "Main Menu" button returns you to the GameShark for Windows main page.

Code Center
-----------
The box in the center of the page shows which games have the most
recently updated cheats.  Click on any game name to go directly to the
Codes Page for that game.  To get to the main Games Page index, click
on the "Click Here For GameShark Codes" link at the bottom of the Code
Center box.

Games History
-------------
The box at the foot of the page shows a list of the most recent games
you've played with GameShark for Windows.  Simply click on the name of the game
to go directly to the Codes Page for that game.

Selecting a Game
----------------
On the Games Page all the games with GameShark for Windows cheats are listed in
alphabetical order.  The list shows a date next to each game - this
indicates when cheats for that game were last updated.

Use the scroll bar to view the whole list, or click on the appropriate
letter group to find the game you want to play.

Once you've found the game you want play, just click on the game name
and you'll be taken to the Codes Page for that game.

Enabling Cheats
---------------
Once you have selected the game you wish to activate cheats for, you'll
be presented with the Codes Page.  Here you can see a list of all the
cheats available for that game with special comments about each cheat
below, and a small check box to the left of each item.

The individual cheats are enabled and disabled using the check boxes in
the left hand column - make sure there is a check mark next to each
cheat you wish to activate.

Once you have selected the cheats you wish to have enabled click on the
"Start Game with Codes" link at the bottom of the page; the game will
start as normal but with the cheats you selected activated.

Code Selector
-------------
The Code Selector is the in-game cheat control dialog.  This is the
part of GameShark for Windows that allows you to turn codes on and off whilst
you are running the game - it is actually responsible for launching the
game with the codes you selected from the main GameShark for Windows screen
(the full screen front end).

After using the game with the codes you can disable or enable other
codes whilst the game is still running using this dialog box.

When you want to alter which codes are on and off simply return to
Windows by pressing the ALT and TAB keys together (or CTRL + Escape, or
one of the Windows keys).

In Windows use the Code Selector dialog to switch codes on and off.  To
toggle a code on or off double-click on the code's name.  When you have
finished selecting which codes you want on and off, click on the "Back
to Game->" button to make GameShark for Windows activate the new settings and
return you to the game.

NOTE:   If you do not use the "Back to Game->" button,
        the codes will not be activated.

 o  A code with an ON icon next to it will be enabled in the game.
    (The cheat name is also displayed in bold).

 o  A code with an OFF icon will not be enabled in the game.

If after returning to the game, the code selector is displayed with one
or more codes marked with the OFF icon and the message "Can't use this
code", then this is because GameShark for Windows could not use this specific
code with your copy of the game.

What this means is that this code was made for a different version of
the game.  GameShark for Windows detected that your version is not the same and
so did not activate the code.  You may be able to obtain an updated
version of the code from the GameShark for Windows website at www.gameshark.com.

As games come out on the PC, the GameShark for Windows code finders will
produce codes for the version of the game they have.  But on the PC,
game publishers release updated versions of the same game.  The
GameShark for Windows code finders constantly update their codes to work with
the latest versions and make them available on the web site.

When you have finished using GameShark for Windows you can click on the "Close
GameShark for Windows" button to switch off all active codes and exit the
GameShark for Windows program.

When you have finished using GameShark for Windows on the current game and wish
to start another, you can click on the "GameShark for Windows Main Menu" button
to switch off all active codes and return to the GameShark for Windows game
selection screen.
